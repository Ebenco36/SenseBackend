                                "Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to phenotypically similar disorders, including hemolytic uremic syndromes (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This review explores the role of the influenza virus as trigger of HUS or TTP. We conducted a literature survey in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Google Scholar using HUS, TTP, TMA, and influenza as keywords, and extracted and @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end reported epidemiological and clinical data. We identified 25 cases of influenza-associated TMA. Five additional cases were linked to influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end separately. Influenza A was found in 83%, 10 out of 25 during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Two patients had bona fide TTP with ADAMTS13 activity <10%. Median age was 15 years (range 0.5\u201368 years), two thirds were male. Oligoanuria was documented in 81% and neurological involvement in 40% of patients. Serum C3 was reduced in 5 out of 14 patients (36%); Coombs test was negative in 7 out of 7 and elevated fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were documented in 6 out of 8 patients. Pathogenic complement gene mutations were found in 7 out of 8 patients tested (C3, MCP, or MCP combined with CFB or clusterin). Twenty out of 24 patients recovered completely, but 3 died (12%). Ten of the surviving patients underwent plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy, 5 plasma infusions. Influenza-mediated HUS or TTP is rare. A sizable proportion of tested patients demonstrated mutations associated with alternative pathway of complement dysregulation that was uncovered by this infection. Further research is warranted targeting the roles of viral neuraminidase, enhanced virus-induced complement activation and/or ADAMTS13 antibodies, and rational treatment approaches."

                                "Background: @hit_startVaccinations@hit_end are among the commonest and most successful medical measures. Due to the drop in the incidence of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases, rare side effects such as allergic reactions are coming more to the fore. In addition, @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end are often associated with the rising prevalence of allergic sensitization and allergic disease. The myth that \u201c@hit_startvaccinations@hit_end cause allergies\u201d is being circulated. This article presents the available evidence on the effect of @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end on the prevalence of atopic manifestations (sensitization, asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy) and atopic dermatitis. Based on position papers, recommendations are given on the approach to @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end in children with allergic disease and/or atopic dermatitis as well as on the approach in patients with anaphylactic reactions to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Methods: A literature search in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and in the reference lists of the identified articles was conducted. Results: There is no evidence that @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end increase the risk of specific allergic sensitization or the manifestation of allergic diseases either in high-risk patients (atopy, positive family history) or in patients with no family history of atopy. @hit_startVaccinations@hit_end do not cause allergies! According to experts, atopic children can be @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end under standard conditions without a mandatory follow-up observation period. Allergy testing should be performed following allergic reactions to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end or @hit_startvaccine@hit_end components. Follow-up @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end after anaphylactic reactions to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end or @hit_startvaccine@hit_end components should be performed under monitoring conditions by physicians experienced in the recognition and treatment of anaphylactic reactions. Conclusion: Standard @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end do not increase the risk for manifesting allergic disease or specific sensitization to environmental allergens. If individual protection is desired, and taking into account the particular risks and provisos, children with allergic disease and anaphylactic reactions to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end can also be @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end."

                                "PURPOSE: There is good evidence that for many behaviours, increasing risk appraisal can lead to a change in behaviour, heightened when efficacy appraisals are also increased. The present @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end addressed whether interventions presenting a risk message increase risk appraisal and an increase in @hit_startvaccination@hit_end intentions and uptake. METHOD: A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials of interventions presenting a risk message and measuring risk appraisal and intentions and uptake post-intervention. Random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end investigated the size of the effect that interventions had on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end risk appraisal and on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end behaviour or intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end, and the size of the relationship between @hit_startvaccination@hit_end risk appraisal and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end intentions and uptake. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included and 16 @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysed@hit_end. Interventions overall had small significant effects on risk appraisal (d = 0.161, p = .047) and perceptions of susceptibility (d = 0.195, p = .025), but no effect on perceptions of severity (d = -0.036, p = .828). Interventions showed no effect on intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end (d = 0.138, p = .195) and no effect on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end behaviour (d = 0.043, p = .826). Interventions typically did not include many behaviour change techniques (BCTs), with the most common BCT unique to intervention conditions being 'Information about Health Consequences'. Few of the included studies attempted to, or successfully increased, efficacy appraisals. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is a lack of good-quality primary studies, and existing interventions are suboptimal. The inclusion of additional BCTs, including those to target efficacy appraisals, could increase intervention effectiveness. The protocol (CRD42015029365) is available from http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Previous research indicates that an increase in risk appraisal is associated with increased uptake in health-related behaviours. Research suggests that interventions increasing risk appraisal have a greater effect on intention when elements of efficacy appraisals are simultaneously increased. What does this study add? This is the first @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end to examine the effect of interventions on risk appraisal and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake using only experimental studies. Limitations of the interventions themselves, and those caused by study methods and reporting, mean that the potential value of this type of review is lost. Instead, its value is in shining a light on the paucity of experimental studies in this area, and the quality of methods and reporting used. Future experimental studies should examine interventions that focus exclusively on increasing risk and efficacy appraisal compared to controls, use conditional measures of risk, and improve reporting to enable both more accurate coding of intervention content and more accurate assessments of study bias."

                                "Background: @hit_startImmunization@hit_end is one of the most effective public health intervention which cam save millions of life globally. @hit_startVaccines@hit_end rarely cause serious adverse reactions, which can be either due to the inherent property of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end product or it can be a coincidental event [1, 2]. DTP containing @hit_startvaccines@hit_end can cause seizures within 3 days of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end [3, 4]. New causality assessment algorithms helps to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end the details of the reported event for the causal association between the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and the event [5]. Objective: To study the association between seizures following DTP containing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and to identify the causal association between the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and the event. Methodology: The retrospective observational study was conducted at a multi specialty hospital where there is an active and spontaneous @hit_startvaccine@hit_end safety surveillance system present. A file having spontaneous reports of serious adverse events following @hit_startimmunization@hit_end (AEFI) for a period of four years was reviewed to identify the seizure cases following DTP containing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. The demographic, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and reported AEFI details were collated for the @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Results: The percentage of seizure with DTP containing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was 78.12% among all the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end SAEs reported in the study and more events were reported (56%) in boys. All the cases were febrile seizures with a mean time gap of 7 hours with a standard deviation of 3.59 hours between the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and first symptom onset. The incidence rate of seizures remain same (24%) for first, second, third and first booster dose of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, but the incidence rate was less (4%) with the second boosteddose. The causal association with the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and the event was coincidental in 28% of the cases where as 78% of events had a consistent causal association to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. All the babies @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end with a product having a whole cell pertussis component and that could be the possible explanation of the seizures. Conclusion: The study concluded that seizures can develop any time during the DTP containing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedule though the babies didn't develop similar events in their previous doses. So the health care professionals should be vigilant to respond quickly to the events and also communicate effectively to the parents to maintain the public confidence in @hit_startvaccines@hit_end."

                                "Introduction Prison inmates can transmit tuberculosis, including drug-resistant strains, to correctional facility workers and the community. In this @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end, we investigated the magnitude of active and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and associated risk factors among correctional facility workers. Methods We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, LILACS, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, and SCOPUS databases (January 1, 1989\u2013December 31, 2017) for studies with the MeSH terms \u201cprison\u201d (and similar) AND \u201ctuberculosis\u201d, without language restriction. We searched for gray literature in Google Scholar and conference proceedings. Stratified @hit_startanalyses@hit_end according to tuberculosis burden were performed. Results Of the 974 titles identified, 15 (nine good, six fair quality) fulfilled the inclusion criteria (110,393 correctional facility workers; six countries; 82,668 active tuberculosis; 110,192 LTBI). Pooled LTBI prevalence and incidence rates were 26% (12\u201342, I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 99.0%) and 2% (1\u20133, I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 98.6%), respectively. LTBI prevalence reached 44% (12\u201379, I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 99.0%) in high-burden countries. Active tuberculosis was reported only in low-burden countries (incidence range, 0.61\u2013450/10,000 correctional facility workers/year). LTBI-associated risk factors included job duration, older age, country of birth, current tobacco smoking, reported contact with prisoners, and BCG @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Conclusion Despite the risk of bias and high heterogeneity, LTBI was found to be prevalent in correctional facility workers, mainly in high-burden countries. LTBI risk factors suggest both occupational and community exposure. Active tuberculosis occurrence in low-burden countries suggests higher vulnerability from recent infection among correctional facility workers in these countries. Systematic surveillance and infection control measures are necessary to protect these highly vulnerable workers."

                                "Background Herpesviruses induce a range of inflammatory effects potentially contributing to an increased risk of stroke. Objectives To investigate whether patients with infection, or reactivation of, human herpesviruses are at increased stroke risk, compared to those without human herpesviruses. Data sources Six medical databases and grey literature sources from inception to January 2017. Study eligibility criteria Studies where the exposure was any human herpesvirus and the outcome was stroke. We included randomised controlled trials, cohort, case-control, case-crossover and self-controlled case series designs. Methods @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end when sufficiently homogeneous studies were available. Quality of evidence across studies was assessed. Results We identified 5012 publications; 41 met the eligibility criteria. Across cohort and self-controlled case series studies, there was moderate quality evidence that varicella infection in children was associated with a short-term increased stroke risk. Zoster was associated with a 1.5-fold increased stroke risk four weeks following onset (summary estimate: 1.55, 95%CI 1.46\u20131.65), which resolved after one year. Subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end suggested post-zoster stroke risk was greater among ophthalmic zoster patients, younger individuals and those not prescribed antivirals. Recent infection/reactivation of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex viruses, but not past infection, was associated with increased stroke risk; however the evidence across studies was mainly derived from small, very low quality case-control studies. Conclusions Our review shows an increased stroke risk following zoster and suggests that recent infection or reactivation of other herpesviruses increases stroke risk, although better evidence is needed. Herpesviruses are common and potentially preventable; these findings may have implications for reducing stroke burden."

                                "Background: Susceptibility to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is high in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). National guidelines in many countries recommend a combined schedule of 1 3-valent pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PCV1 3) beginning after birth followed by the 23-valent polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PPSV23) beginning at age 2 years. In Africa, where the burden of SCD is greatest, PPSV23 is generally unavailable and not routinely administered to children with SCD. To help inform optimal @hit_startimmunization@hit_end regimens for children with SCD in West Africa, we sought to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of IPD in the region. We focused specifically on the 24 combined pneumococcus strains covered by PCV13 (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 1 8C, 1 9A, 19F, and 23F) and PPSV23 (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 1 0A, 11 A, 1 2F, 14, 1 5B, 1 7F, 1 8C, 19A, 1 9F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F). This @hit_startanalysis@hit_end also explored the epidemiology of IPD-associated serotypes after the introduction of routine PCV1 3 @hit_startimmunization@hit_end in countries in West Africa. Methods: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of published @hit_startliterature@hit_end between 1990 and January 201 7 using BIOSIS Previews, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, and Ovid @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end. Inclusion criteria were all investigations that reported estimates of prevalence or incidence and the specific serotype distribution profile of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae (including bacteremia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, or pneumonia) in children and adults in ECOWAS-defined West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The search strategy utilized various combinations of relevant keywords and MeSH headings. Timing of the introduction of routine PCV1 3 @hit_startimmunization@hit_end into study countries was determined through WHO national @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage surveillance data. We generated maps of the spatial distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in countries with available data using R (version 3.3.3). Results: The search yielded 540 unique studies. We excluded 395 papers based on title and abstract. The remaining 1 45 studies underwent full text review. Twenty papers (representing 20 datasets and 1980 isolates) met inclusion criteria. Gambia had the most datasets (5); no data were available from six countries (Benin, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); and at least one dataset was available from each of the remaining 8 countries. The most frequent invasive serotypes reported across countries were 1, 5, 6A, 1 2F, 14, and 23F; together, these represented 79.7% of all serotypes identified in IPD in children and adults in West Africa. Most (89.2%) of the serotypes identified are included in PCV1 3. However, serotypes 2 and 1 2F, which are covered only by PPSV23, represented 3.3% and 4.8% of identified IPD serotypes, respectively, across the 9 countries studied. These serotypes also accounted for up to 10% of isolates found in individual countries. PCV1 3 was introduced into all countries with datasets @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end between 2011 and 201 5. Only 1 dataset identified in the literature search (Ghana) was obtained after the introduction of routine pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, which precluded @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of the impact of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on temporal trends in serotype incidence. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first attempt to aggregate IPD serotype data across West Africa. While the majority of serotypes identified are included in PCV1 3, two serotypes exclusive to PPSV23 (2 and 1 2F) together accounted for 8.1% of the total IPD burden. Moreover, in some countries, the proportion of strains included in PPSV23 and not PCV1 3 is higher. @hit_startImmunizing@hit_end persons with SCD in West Africa with PPSV23 T may be warranted to optimize protection from IPD. Furthermore, as PCV1 3 @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage increases, it is possible that the epidemiolo may shift to more strains exclusively covered by PPSV23. This @hit_startanalysis@hit_end is limited by its retrospective nature and the paucity of data available after introduction of routine pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Further work, including dynamic IPD surveillance and disease modeling, is needed to better u@sup_beginJu@sup_endn@sup_beginm@sup_endd@sup_beginp@sup_ender @sup_begint@sup_ends@sup_begino@sup_endtand the epidemiology of pneumococcus in West Africa with the aim of keeping vulnerable populations, such as those with SCD, safe from IPD."

                                "Introduction: Rationale for anticancer @hit_startvaccine@hit_end therapy is based on humoral and/or cellular response against unique tumor antigens (Ag). Peptide @hit_startvaccines@hit_end specific for Ag are under investigation for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Among cell-based @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC) fused with myeloma cells serve as Ag presenting cells to develop an immune response against a variety of targets. The purpose of this study is to report clinical response and tolerability of anti-myeloma @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Methods: We included phase I and I/II trials developed between January 2008 to December 2017, where @hit_startvaccines@hit_end or viruses were used against MM, irrespective of the geo-location, age, and sex. We performed a comprehensive literature search (last update 3-30-2018) using the following databases: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, AdisInsight, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Results: The initial search identified 2537 early phase studies. After screening by 2 reviewers and categorization by mechanism of action, 25 clinical trials (CT) that involved @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and/or viruses were included. We added 1 CT after the manual search. Therapy was given to 3 distinct classes of patients: patients without prior treatment (high risk smoldering MM or stage I MM, 4 CT), as an adjunct therapy for patients undergoing FDA approved treatments [high dose chemotherapy (HDT), allogeneic (allo-SCT) or autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), 9 CT], and patients with residual or relapsed/refractory (RR) disease after FDA approved therapies (11 CT). Of the included 25 CT, 14 have published results available for @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. For patients without prior treatments, PVX-410, a multi-peptide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, resulted in at least minimal response (MR) in 50% of patients when combined with lenalidomiden and achieved stable disease (SD) for 60% of patients when used alone at 12 months follow up. Treatment with Idiotype-pulsed mature MMDC targeting idiotype proteins in MM showed MR in 30% of patients and SD in 43% of patients at 12 months. For patients receiving @hit_startvaccines@hit_end as an adjuvant treatment, recMAGE-A3 resulted in complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR) in 46% and 54% respectively, at 3 months post ASCT follow up. By 12 months post ASCT, these responses were 38% CR and 23% VGPR. Treatment with MDDC (MAGE3 + Survivin + BCMA) resulted in SD in 42% of patients at a median of 25 months post @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and 55 months post ASCT. ScFv-FrC, a DNA fusion @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, resulted in CR in 50% and MR/SD in 21% at 52 weeks post @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Ongoing CR/PR was maintained for 3+ years in 57 % patients, 4+ years in 36%, and 5+ years in 14% of patients following ASCT; OS was 64% after a median follow up of 85.6 months. Patients treated with MDDCs/tumor cells fusion @hit_startvaccine@hit_end had 69% SD after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and 20% SD at a median of 26 months. When @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were given as a salvage therapy in RR MM, ImMucin @hit_startvaccine@hit_end showed a CR in 30% of patients during treatment, 20% maintained CR, and 13% had SD at a median of 24 months. Galinpepimut-S @hit_startvaccine@hit_end showed CR or very good partial response (VGPR) in 37% of patients at a median of 12 months, and 26% CR and VGPR at 18 months, with a progression free survival rate of 23.6 months. Patients receiving mHag loaded host MDDC @hit_startvaccination@hit_end also showed 8% CR for > 6 years (n=1) and 8% PR for 19 weeks (n=1); 33% had SD. Reolysin (wild-type reovirus), a virus-based @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, was used in 3 trials for RR MM patients. When alone, 42% of patients had SD and 58% had PD. When combined with dexamethasone and bortezomib 37% of patients had SD lasting for 3 cycles. Whereas, when combined with dexamethasone and carfilzomib, all patients had decrease in monoclonal proteins, with VGPR reported in 28%, PR in 43%, MR in 8%, and SD in 8% patients after 8 cycles. Most @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were well tolerated by patients, only grade (G) 1 and G2 side effects (SE), which were mostly flu-like symptoms and local skin reactions. G3 SE included pneumonia with mHag DC and Bcl2 peptide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, GVHD with hTERT tumor @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, DVT and rash seen with scFv-FrC DNA @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. G4 SE were rare, but seen with reolysin, requiring 2 patients to be removed from study, and with DC/tumor cell fusion @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (1 pulmonary embolism). Conclusion Anti-myeloma @hit_startvaccination@hit_end therapy appears to be well tolerated, which makes it a promising adjuvant therapeutic agent against MM. Current data reveals positive immunologic activity in most patients and there is possibility of promising clinical responses with further drug development."

                                "Introduction FNAIT is associated with severe bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), in the fetus and/or newborn. More than 75% of ICHs occur in utero and up to 50% before 32 weeks gestation. The consequences of ICH include death (35%) or serious neurological sequelae in survivors (83%). FNAIT requires prompt identification and treatment antepartum, postpartum and in subsequent pregnancies. An international panel was convened by the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG) to develop evidence based recommendations for diagnosis and management of FNAIT. Methods The international panel consisted of specialists in adult and pediatric hematology, maternal fetal medicine (MFM), neonatology, methodology, transfusion medicine, and a patient representative. Clinical questions were developed for diagnostic testing, antenatal screening and management, and postnatal interventions. A systematic search for articles published between 1 946 and June 201 7 in @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end was conducted. Recommendations were formulated based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method which incorporates the quality of the evidence, benefits and risks, and resource utilization. Web conferences and electronic correspondence were used to discuss the results of the @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end and formulate recommendations. Considerations for clinical practice such as dosing of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids were detailed. Electronic surveys were sent to all members to assess agreement with recommendations. The final guidance document was sent to maternal fetal, hematology and pediatric societies for comments. Results Three @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end (antenatal management, postnatal management and use of laboratory investigations to identify pregnancies at risk) were developed. Antenatal recommendations: Women with FNAIT in a previous pregnancy or sisters of women with FNAIT should be referred to MFM centers. Fetal HPA typing (e.g. HPA-1 a/1 b) should be performed in HPA-@hit_startimmunized@hit_end pregnant women when the paternity is unknown or the partner is heterozygous or unavailable for testing. Prenatal HPA-1 typing should preferentially be performed by a non-invasive method e.g. cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma if adequately quality assured. Antenatal IVIG administration to the mother commencing at 1 2-16 weeks gestation should be offered to all women in a subsequent pregnancy with maternal fetal incompatibility who have had a previous fetus or neonate with FNAIT related ICH. For all other pregnancies with a previous neonate with FNAIT (without ICH), administering antenatal IVIG to the mother should be discussed prior to a subsequent pregnancy or when pregnancy with maternal fetal incompatibility is confirmed. If corticosteroids are used w dexamethasone should not be used because of the associated risk of oligohydramnios. Postnatal recommendations: HPA-selected platelets be made available at delivery for potentially affected infants to increase the neonatal platelet count. If HPA-selected platelets are not immed available, unselected platelets should be used. In the presence of life-threatening neonatal hemorrhage such as intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding, platelets should be transfused to maintain platelet counts above 50 to 100x10@sup_begin9@sup_end/L for at least 7 days. In the absence of life-threatening bleed ing in a neonate such as intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding, platelets should be transfused to maintain a platelet count above 30x10@sup_begin9@sup_end/L. Conclusions The intent of this guidance document developed from @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end is to promote best practices in the management of FNAIT. The guideline development group developed algorithms for treatment, podcasts for physicians and patients, pamphlets for patients and a slide set to assist with the implementation of recommendations into practice. This expert panel identified key areas for future research. One is the optimal approach to antenatal management of the next affected pregnancy. Developing biomarkers of fetal severity would be critical to this endeavor. In addition, creating comprehensive screening to identify HPA-1b1b women at risk of FNAIT would advance successful prevention of this disease."
