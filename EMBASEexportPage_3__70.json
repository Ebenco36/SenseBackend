Aims: To review, from an Infectious Diseases perspective, the safety profile of agents targeting interleukins, immunoglobulins and complement factors and to suggest preventive recommendations. Sources: Computer-based @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end searches with MeSH terms pertaining to each agent or therapeutic family. Content: Patients receiving interleukin-1 (IL-1) -targeted (anakinra, canakinumab or rilonacept) or IL-5-targeted (mepolizumab) agents have a moderate risk of infection and no specific prevention strategies are recommended. The use of IL-6/IL-6 receptor-targeted agents (tocilizumab and siltuximab) is associated with a risk increase similar to that observed with anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 agents. IL-12/23-targeted agents (ustekinumab) do not seem to pose a meaningful risk of infection, although screening for latent tuberculosis infection may be considered and antiviral prophylaxis should be given to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients. Therapy with IL-17-targeted agents (secukinumab, brodalumab and ixekizumab) may result in the development of mild-to-moderate mucocutaneous candidiasis. Pre-treatment screening for Strongyloides stercoralis and other geohelminths should be considered in patients who come from areas where these are endemic who are receiving IgE-targeted agents (omalizumab). C5-targeted agents (eculizumab) are associated with a markedly increased risk of infection due to encapsulated bacteria, particularly Neisseria spp. Meningococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and chemoprophylaxis must be administered 2\u20134 weeks before initiating eculizumab. Patients with high-risk behaviours and their partners should also be screened for gonococcal infection. Implications: Preventive strategies are particularly encouraged to minimize the occurrence of neisserial infection associated with eculizumab."

                                "BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions remain essential in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and \u03b2-thalassemia. Alloimmunization, a well-documented complication of transfusion, increases the risk of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, complicates crossmatching and identifying compatible units, and delays provision of transfusions. Guidance is required to optimize the RBC product administered to these patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An international, multidisciplinary team conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and developed, following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, recommendations to assist treating physicians and transfusion specialists in their decision to select RBCs for these patients. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (17 clinical studies and one cost-effectiveness study) were included in the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end. The overall quality of the studies was very low. In total, 3696 patients were included: 1680 with \u03b2-thalassemia and 2016 with SCD. CONCLUSION: The panel recommends that ABO D CcEe K\u2013matched RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and \u03b2-thalassemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies, to reduce the risk of alloimmunization. In patients with SCD and \u03b2-thalassemia who have developed clinically significant alloantibodies, selection of RBCs antigen negative to the alloantibody is recommended, if feasible. In these patients, selection of more extended phenotype-matched RBCs will likely reduce the risk of further alloimmunization. However, given the limited availability of extended phenotype-matched units, attention should be given to ensure that a delay in transfusion does not adversely affect patient care."

                                "In addition to improved water supply and sanitation, the 2-dose killed oral cholera @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (OCV) is an important tool for the prevention and control of cholera. We aimed to document the immunogenicity and protection (efcacy and effectiveness) conferred by a single OCV dose against cholera. Te @hit_startmetaanalysis@hit_end showed that an estimated 73% and 77% of individuals seroconverted to the Ogawa and Inaba serotypes, respectively, afer an OCV frst dose. Te estimates of single-dose @hit_startvaccine@hit_end protection from available studies are 87% at 2 months decreasing to 33% at 2 years. Current immunologic and clinical data suggest that protection conferred by a single dose of killed OCV may be sufcient to reduce short-term risk in outbreaks or other high-risk settings, which may be especially useful when @hit_startvaccine@hit_end supply is limited. However, until more data suggest otherwise, a second dose should be given as soon as circumstances allow to ensure robust protection."

                                "Background Influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is a commonly used intervention to prevent influenza infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) and onward transmission to other staff and patients. We undertook a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end to synthesize the latest evidence of the direct epidemiological and economic effectiveness of seasonal influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end among HCW. Methods We conducted a systematic search of @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end/@hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus, and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1980 through January 2018. All studies comparing @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end and non-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end (i.e. placebo or non-intervention) groups of HCWs were included. Research articles that focused on only patient-related outcomes or monovalent A(H1N1) pdm09 @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were excluded. Two reviewers independently selected articles and extracted data. Pooled-@hit_startanalyses@hit_end were conducted on morbidity outcomes including laboratory-confirmed influenza, influenza-like illnesses (ILI), and absenteeism. Economic studies were summarized for the characteristics of methods and findings. Results Thirteen articles met eligibility criteria: three articles were randomized controlled studies and ten were cohort studies. Pooled results showed a significant effect on laboratory-confirmed influenza incidence but not ILI. While the overall incidence of absenteeism was not changed by @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, ILI absenteeism was significantly reduced. The duration of absenteeism was also shortened by @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. All published economic evaluations consistently found that the @hit_startimmunization@hit_end of HCW was cost saving based on crude estimates of avoided absenteeism by @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. No studies, however, comprehensively evaluated both health outcomes and costs of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programs to examine cost-effectiveness. Discussion Our findings reinforced the influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effects in reducing infection incidence and length of absenteeism. A better understanding of the incidence of absenteeism and comprehensive economic program evaluations are required to ensure the best possible management of ill HCWs and the investment in HCW @hit_startimmunization@hit_end in increasingly constrained financial environments. These steps are fundamental to establish sustainability and cost-effectiveness of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programs and underpin HCW @hit_startimmunization@hit_end policy."

                                "Objective. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end is a key strategy to reduce infection risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is advocated in internationally recognized rheumatology society guidelines. The aim was to evaluate to the effect of antirheumatic drugs on influenza and pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end immunogenicity. Methods. We conducted a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end and @hit_startmetaanalysis@hit_end comparing the humoral response to influenza (pandemic and seasonal trivalent subunit @hit_startvaccines@hit_end) and pneumococcal (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated @hit_startvaccines@hit_end) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in adult patients with RA treated with antirheumatic drugs. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end immunogenicity was assessed by seroprotection rates measured 3 to 6 weeks postimmunization. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI were pooled. Results. Nine studies were included in the @hit_startmetaanalysis@hit_end (7 studies investigating antirheumatic drug exposures and influenza humoral response, 2 studies investigating pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end response). Influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end responses to all subunit strains (H1N1, H3N2, B strain) were preserved with methotrexate (MTX) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) drug exposure. MTX but not TNFi drug exposure was associated with reduced 6B and 23F serotype pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end response (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28-0.63 vs RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.58-1.67); however, limited data were available to draw any firm conclusions. Combination of MTX with tocilizumab or tofacitinib was associated with reduced pneumococcal and influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end responses. Conclusion. Antirheumatic drugs may limit humoral responses to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end as evidenced by pneumococcal responses with MTX exposure; however, they are safe and should not preclude @hit_startimmunization@hit_end against @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end disease. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end should be considered in all patients with RA and encouraged as part of routine care."

                                "Background Acellular pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end studies postulate that waning protection, particularly after the adolescent booster, is a major contributor to the increasing US pertussis incidence. However, these studies reported relative (ie, vs a population given prior doses of pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end), not absolute (ie, vs a pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end na\u00efve population) efficacy following the adolescent booster. We aim to estimate the absolute protection offered by acellular pertussis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Methods We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of acellular pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness (VE) publications. Studies had to comply with the US schedule, evaluate clinical outcomes, and report VE over discrete time points. VE after the 5-dose childhood series and after the adolescent sixth-dose booster were extracted separately and pooled. All relative VE estimates were transformed to absolute estimates. VE waning was estimated using @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression modeling. Findings Three studies reported VE after the childhood series and four after the adolescent booster. All booster studies reported relative VE (vs acellular pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-primed@hit_end population). We estimate initial childhood series absolute VE is 91% (95% CI: 87% to 95%) and declines at 9.6% annually. Initial relative VE after adolescent boosting is 70% (95% CI: 54% to 86%) and declines at 45.3% annually. Initial absolute VE after adolescent boosting is 85% (95% CI: 84% to 86%) and declines at 11.7% (95% CI: 11.1% to 12.3%) annually. Interpretation Acellular pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy is initially high and wanes over time. Observational VE studies of boosting failed to recognize that they were measuring relative, not absolute, VE and the absolute VE in the boosted population is better than appreciated."

                                "Introduction: A case of Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE) 2 months after a typhoid fever and meningococcal C @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in a 27-year-old woman has been recently reported to our Centre. APMPPE is a rare inflammatory chorioretinal disease that occurs in young adults, with a sex ratio of 1:1. It is clinically characterized by sudden visual loss, affecting both eyes in 80% of cases. The diagnosis is mainly based on ophthalmoscopy that reveals characteristic white-yellow placoid lesions of varying sizes. Outcome is mostly favorable with spontaneous healing over a few weeks and progressive good recovery of visual acuity in several months. Several causes of APMPPE have been suggested, including infections, sarcoidosis and drugs like @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. We aimed to review reports of APMPPE involving @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in the literature and the French Pharmacovigilance database (FPVD). Material and methods: We queried @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Reactions Weekly online in October 2017. We searched for all reports of \u201cRetinal pigment epitheliopathy\u201d (MedDRA Preferred Term) in the FPVD and selected those involving @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. We collected characteristics of patients, nature of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, time to onset and outcome of APMPPE. Results: We identified 7 cases of APMPPE involving @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in the literature and 3 in the FPVD (including our case), reported between 1978 and 2017. The median age of patients was 25.5 years old (11-31), and 60% occurred in men. Of the 10 cases, 2 involved several @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Suspected @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were flu (n = 4), typhoid fever (n = 2), hepatitis B (n = 2), hepatitis A (n = 1), meningococcal C (n = 1), meningococcal A+C (n = 1), chickenpox (n = 1) and Japanese encephalitis (n = 1) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. The median time to onset of APMPPE was 14 days (2 days to 2 months). For 7 patients, oral corticosteroids were initiated. Complete visual acuity restoration and regression of retinal lesions without recurrence were reported in 3 cases. In the 7 other cases, sight restoration and regression of lesions were only partial (persistence of a central scotoma in 3 cases), with time of follow-up varying from 1 month to 1 year. Discussion/Conclusion: Our case is the second reporting the occurrence of APMPPE following a typhoid @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and the first following meningococcal C @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; only one case has been reported after meningococcal A+C @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Although current data do not allow establishing a definite association between @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and APMPPE, clinicians should be aware of this potential rare adverse effect."

                                "Objectives: This study aims to establish the first national treatment recommendations by the Turkish League Against Rheumatism (TLAR) for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) based on the current evidence. Materials and methods: A @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end was performed regarding the management of PsA. The TLAR expert committee consisted of 13 rheumatologists and 12 physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists experienced in the treatment and care of patients with PsA from 22 centers. The TLAR recommendations were built on those of European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2015. Levels of evidence and agreement were determined. Results: Recommendations included five overarching principles and 13 recommendations covering therapies for PsA, particularly focusing on musculoskeletal involvement. Level of agreement was greater than eight for each item. Conclusion: This is the first paper that summarizes the recommendations of TLAR as regards the treatment of PsA. We believe that this paper provides Turkish physicians dealing with PsA patients a practical guide in their routine clinical practice."

                                "Context: Hepatitis B viral infection, specially in children, is an unsolved global health issue. National and international @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programs, as the main means to prevent this infection, have been operating for years. This @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end study was launched to investigate the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end efficacy in under five-year-old children in Iran. Evidence Acquisition: In this research, all national databases including, SID, Magiran, Iran medex, Iran doc, and Medlib, as well as international databases, including @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startMedline@hit_end, and ISI were searched for published articles associated with evaluation of seroconversion rates after hepatitis-B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in Iranian children. The search was performed in the Persian and/or English language and in under five-year-old children in Iran. The variance of each study was calculated using the binomial distribution formula. The results of studies were combined using random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end model. Data were @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end using STATA version 12. Results: In the present research, 11 studies, performed from 2000 to 2017, were investigated. The number of samples in these 11 studies were 3063 children (1592 males and 1471 females). In the studies, the efficacy range of the hepatitis-B @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in under fiveyear-old children in Iran was 89% (95% CI: 86% 93%) with high heterogeneity (P value for heterogeneity was 0.001, I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 92.9). Range of efficacy for males and females was 85% (95% CI: 78 to 91) and 88% (95% CI: 83 to 93), respectively. Conclusions: The hepatitis B virus (HBV) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end program in Iran seems to be highly effective although some questions, such as the effect of gender on responsiveness to @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and heterogeneity of different data, remain unclear."

                                "Tuberculosis is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, estimated to cause approximately 1 million new cases and 250,000 deaths per year.@sup_begin1,2@sup_end Almost 80% of TB-associated deaths occur before five years of age and many are never diagnosed.@sup_begin1@sup_end Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is the commonest form of childhood TB globally. Pulmonary TB has been regarded as a chronic disease, associated with persistent symptoms. Symptoms of chronic cough, loss of weight or failure to thrive in the context of an epidemiological suspicion for TB such as a household contact or a positive tuberculin skin test in a child who comes from a TB endemic area have been key features of the diagnosis of pediatric PTB. However, increasing evidence links M. tuberculosis with acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Studies from TB endemic areas in Africa have reported culture-confirmed TB in approximately 8% of children presenting with acute LRTI.@sup_begin3@sup_end As the sensitivity of culture for diagnosis of PTB is sub-optimal, it is likely that the true number of children with M. tuberculosis in the context of LRTI is much higher. A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of hospital-based studies of children under 5 years of age with a severe LRTI found high rates of PTB ranging from 1-23% (with rates of 5-8% for culture-confirmed tuberculosis).3 The median duration of cough in children with culture-confirmed TB was approximately 4 days in children hospitalized with culture-confirmed disease in South Africa.@sup_begin4@sup_end However there is no clear evidence that pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in infants has reduced subsequent hospitalization for pulmonary TB.@sup_begin5@sup_end HIV-infected children are at higher risk for developing PTB compared to HIV-negative children, but the risk of PTB is substantially reduced by the use of antiretroviral therapy and preventive therapy.@sup_begin6-8@sup_end PTB may be especially important to consider in HIV-infected children presenting with acute LRTI in TB endemic areas, especially if they are not on antiretroviral therapy or have significant immunosuppression. High rates of tuberculin conversion (11.8 conversion per 100 childyears; 11.8% annual risk of infection) and tuberculosis disease (2.9 pediatric cases per 100 child-years) were found in the Drakenstein Child Health study, amongst the highest reported estimates of pediatric tuberculosis globally.@sup_begin9@sup_end In this cohort, tuberculosis disease and the occurrence of LRTI or recurrent LRTI were strongly associated and both were highly endemic in this cohort. These two conditions may be risk factors for each other or there may be common risk factors for both. In contrast use of INH prophylaxis amongst children with a positive tuberculin skin test was highly protective for development of disease. The challenges of accurately diagnosing childhood TB and of obtaining microbiological confirmation in children may lead to underestimation of the burden of TB, particularly when associated with LRTI. Programs for LRTI and tuberculosis should be integrated. Children living in TB endemic areas should be routinely, regularly tested for TB infection and prevention programs strengthened. Screening for TB disease should be done when a child presents with LRTI. Further study of the mechanisms of interaction of LRTI and TB in children are needed."
