It is unclear what the geographical information means: is it the location of review authors, or location of primary studies? I found errors there: if you select ""Uganda"", a review is shown that has nothing to do with this country. I do not understand what the difference is between ""data exploration"" and ""multiple reviews"".  The ""topic"" filter function gives implausible results (e.g., ""modelling"" or ""administration"" give incorrect results). ""Language"" is not necessary because we only deal with English language reviews. ""The ""Summary"" page shows a landscape - but this is rather irrelevant for systematic review users. Landing page: this information on sources is not necessarily what a user expects to see on a landing page: the total number of reviews is relevant, duplications from multiple sources might be relevant. Information over time is relevant. "
