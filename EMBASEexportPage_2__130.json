                                "Objective. To develop recommendations for the assessment of people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Canada. Methods. Recommendations were developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. The Canadian SLE Working Group (panel of Canadian rheumatologists and a patient representative from Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance) was created. Questions for recommendation development were identified based on the results of a previous survey of SLE practice patterns of members of the Canadian Rheumatology Association. @hit_startSystematic literature reviews@hit_end of randomized trials and observational studies were conducted. Evidence to Decision tables were prepared and presented to the panel at 2 face-to-face meetings and online. Results. There are 15 recommendations for assessing and monitoring SLE, with varying applicability to adult and pediatric patients. Three recommendations focus on diagnosis, disease activity, and damage assessment, suggesting the use of a validated disease activity score per visit and annual damage score. Strong recommendations were made for cardiovascular risk assessment and measuring anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies in the peripartum period and conditional recommendations for osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. Two conditional recommendations were made for peripartum assessments, 1 for cervical cancer screening and 2 for hepatitis B and C screening. A strong recommendation was made for annual influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Conclusion. These are considered the first guidelines using the GRADE method for the monitoring of SLE. Existing evidence is largely of low to moderate quality, resulting in more conditional than strong recommendations. Additional rigorous studies and special attention to pediatric SLE populations and patient preferences are needed."

The Korean clinical practice guideline for COPD was revised in 2018. The guideline was drafted by the members of the Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases as well as the participating members of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, Korean Physicians' Association, and Korea Respiration Trouble Association. The revised guideline encompasses a wide range of topics, including the epidemiology, diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, management, exacerbation, and comorbidities of COPD in Korea. We performed @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end assisted by an expert in @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end to draft a guideline on COPD management. We expect this guideline to facilitate the treatment of patients with respiratory conditions by physicians as well other health care professionals and government personnel in South Korea."

                                "Background: Despite the availability of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, HBV remains the cause of significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Immunologic response, and developing @hit_startimmunity@hit_end to the HBV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end varies significantly among patients, some studies have reported response rates as low as 20%. Multiple studies looked at patients who are at risk non-response, and individually offered approaches to patients who do not respond. There is lack of evidence regarding approaches to HBV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end non-responders in the current @hit_startliterature@hit_end. This systemic @hit_startreview@hit_end aims to study best approaches to HBV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end non-response in all previously reported articles. Methods: We searched the database @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end for all articles on HBV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end response, non-response in all previously reported patient populations with decreased response to HBV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end including: 'obesity', 'Human immunodeficiency virus', 'immunosuppressed patient', concurrent hepatitis C', 'liver cirrhosis', 'diabetes', 'hypoalbuminemia', 'chronic kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'advanced age', and 'inflammatory bowel disease' from 1981 to January 2018. Recommended and tested approaches to non-response were isolated. Results: A total of 582 studies were isolated, a total of 48 adequate quality studies with 9082 patients were included. Repeat @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with the same dose increased immunologic seroconversion in 85.7% of previously reported non-responders, and over 90% in patients with ESRD, HD, obese, HIV, immosuppressed, HCV infected individuals, advanced age patients, patients with hypoalbuminemia and those with liver cirrhosis. Patients with IBD and diabetes had a milder response of 67.5%. Increasing the dose of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end to 40\u03bcg improved seroconversion in HIV, HCV, obese, and HD patients to 78.7% in initial non-responders. Subcuteanous injection route increased response in patients with HIV by 12%. The use of delta inulin adjuvant has been studied in animals with some promising results however no data in humans. Concurrent administration of oral drugs that have immunomodulatory effects such as Levamisole and Parziquantel have been studied in small trials and were noted to increase HBV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end response by 10-12% in previously @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end non-responders. Conclusion: Patients not responding to initial @hit_startvaccine@hit_end series benefit from re-@hit_startimmunization@hit_end with repeating the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end series or a single higher dose @hit_startvaccine@hit_end booster. Although the overall response is approximately 90% of previous non-responders, the rate varies among populations studied. (Table Presented)."

                                "Recognising that the current inconsistency in outcome collection and reporting is a serious hindrance to progress in women's and newborn health research, editors of almost 80 journals have formed a consortium to support the development, dissemination, and implementation of core outcome sets - CoRe Outcomes in Women's and Newborn health (CROWN) initiative. Core outcome set represents a minimum set of outcomes selected and prioritised by key stakeholders (healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients) to be routinely collected and reported in randomised trials and @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end. The existence or use of a core outcome set does not imply that outcomes in trials should be restricted. Rather, there is an expectation that the core outcomes will be collected and reported, making it easier for the results of trials to be compared, contrasted and combined as appropriate; while researchers continue to explore other outcomes as well. Harmonisation of what to measure needs to goes hand in hand with the unification of measures. Standardisation of case definitions and other research tools by Global Alignment of @hit_startImmunization@hit_end Safety Assessment in Pregnancy (GAIA) consortium is a fine example of further improvements in women's and newborn health research. The aims of the session are: \u2022 To understand why do we need core outcome sets \u2022 To learn how core outcome sets are being developed and how to implement them ensuring their global relevance \u2022 To understand the importance of other outcome-related standardisation efforts \u2022 To develop awareness and build confidence to develop core outcome set."

                                "Background: Blau syndrome is a monogenic autoinflammatory condition of early childhood resulting from mutations in the gene for pattern recognition receptor NOD2 (chromosomal region 16q12.1). It presents with a classic phenotypic triad of granulomatous polyarthritis, uveitis and dermatitis. Due to the rarity of the condition (incidence <1 per 1.5million) there is a paucity of evidence regarding management, especially for cutaneous manifestations. Methods: We describe a case and @hit_startliterature review@hit_end of refractory rash associated with Blau syndrome. Case report An 11 week old female was referred to dermatology with persistent and widespread papular rash present since two weeks of age and was diagnosed with papular urticaria. The rash was flexural but not puritic and did not respond to modrasone cream. Total IgE level (4) excluded atopic eczema. Punch biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation prompting the possibility of sarcoidosis. Further investigation excluded infectious causes. Serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme was slightly high (72) and chest-x-ray was normal. One month of oral prednisone (20mg decreasing by 5mg/week) provided partial improvement. At paediatric rheumatology assessment the 21 month old's rash was noted to be consistent with Blau syndrome. There was no joint or eye involvement. A novel NOD2 mutation c.1808A>G, p.(His603Arg) was confirmed. Methotrexate commenced for steroid sparing which only briefly resolved the rash and further dose increments proved futile. Asymptomatic tenosynovitis (wrists and ankles) without arthritis developed aged 27 months on methotrexate at 15mg/m2. Hydroxychloroquine was added but later stopped due to lack of efficacy. Slit lamp examination was first possible aged three years and revealed mild band keratopathy (right eye) raising the possibility of previous uveitis. Rash flared following routine @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Acute uveitis occurred two months later and subsequently active polyarticular arthritis developed (involving both wrists). Adalimumab 20mg every two weeks was commenced (aged three years seven months). The previously refractory rash improved rapidly, disappearing by the four week follow up. Arthritis and uveitis remain in remission after three months. Results: A literature search conducted with @hit_startPubMed@hit_end using terms (Blau syndrome OR early onset sarcoidosis) AND Adalimumab provided nine results. Five articles referred solely to uveitis. A search substituting biologic for adalimumab gave fifteen results. Six of the nine patients described receiving adalimumab obtained remission. There was no specific reports of improvement of rash with any biologic. One case reported flare of rash following @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Conclusion: Refractive rash is a rare manifestation of Blau syndrome and treatment response is not well reported. Due to good evidence of efficacy in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and uveitis we suggest that adalimumab is a potentially useful treatment. Further research is required to confirm efficacy and stratify its use. This is the first reported case of chronic skin involvement responding to adalimumab, in Blau syndrome with a novel NOD2 mutation."

                                "Background: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease neglected, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, considered a public health problem because may cause permanent physical disabilities and deformities, leading to severe limitations. This review presents an overview of the results of epidemiological studies on leprosy occurrence in childhood in Brazil, aiming to alert health planners and managers to the actual need to institute special control strategies. Methodology/Principal findings: Data collection consisted of an electronic search for publications in eight databases: Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade (LILACS), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), @hit_startPuBMed@hit_end, Biblioteca Virtual em Sa\u00fade (BVS), SciVerse Scopus (Scopus), CAPES theses database, CAPES journals database and Web of Science of papers published up to 2016. After apply selection criteria, twenty-two papers of studies conducted in four different regions of Brazil and published between 2001 and 2016 were included in the review. The leprosy detection rate ranged from 10.9 to 78.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. Despite affecting both sexes, leprosy was more common in boys and in 10-14-year-olds. Although the authors reported a high cure proportion (82\u201390%), between 1.7% and 5.5% of the individuals developed a disability resulting from the disease. Conclusions/Significance: The findings of this review shows that leprosy situation in Brazilian children under 15 years is extremely adverse in that the leprosy detection rate remains high in the majority of studies. The proportion of cases involving disability is also high and reflects the difficulties and the poor effectiveness of actions aimed at controlling the disease. The authors suggest the development of studies in spatial clusters of leprosy, where beyond the routine actions established, are included news strategies of active search and campaigns and actions of educations inside the clusters of this disease. The new agenda needs to involve the precepts of ethical, humane and supportive care, in order to achieve a new level of leprosy control in Brazil."

                                "Background: The temporal and spatial change in trends of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in typhoid have not been systematically studied, and such information will be critical for defining intervention, as well as planning sustainable prevention strategies. Methodology and findings: To identify the phenotypic trends in AMR, 13,833 individual S. Typhi isolates, reported from 1973 to 2018 in 62 publications, were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end to determine the AMR preponderance over time. Separate @hit_startanalyses@hit_end of molecular resistance determinants present in over 4,000 isolates reported in 61 publications were also conducted. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) typhoid is in decline in Asia in a setting of high fluoroquinolone resistance while it is on the increase in Africa. Mutations in QRDRs in gyrA (S83F, D87N) and parC (S80I) are the most common mechanisms responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance. Cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi, dubbed extensively drug-resistant (XDR) is a real threat and underscores the urgency in deploying the Vi-conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Conclusion: From these observations, it appears that AMR in S. Typhi will continue to emerge leading to treatment failure, changes in antimicrobial policy and further resistance developing in S. Typhi isolates and other Gram-negative bacteria in endemic regions. The deployment of typhoid conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to control the disease in endemic regions may be the best defence."

                                "Background: Infections represent a significant threat for HIV patients, with higher attack rates and an increased risk for severe and complicated illness, especially when CD4 counts fall below 200 cells/ mm3. Despite existing recommendations, HIV patients may not be immune to @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases due to @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end schedules not being @hit_startsystematically reviewed@hit_end during routine consultations, as well as concerns over vaccinal side effects and efficacy in this immunocompromised population. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of an electronic @hit_startvaccine@hit_end record on the @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end status of HIV patients in Geneva. Materials and methods: In this controlled before-and-after cohort study, a total of 328 HIV patients were enrolled between 1 May 2016 and 10 April 2018 at the Infectious Diseases Division of the University Hospitals of Geneva. A vaccinology consultation was offered systematically to all adult patients. After oral consent, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end history was taken and @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end status documented in a national electronic @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end registry (www.myvaccines.ch), which was accessible by the collaborators of the HIV Division, the patients themselves and their general practitioners. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end status was assessed by an expert clinical decision support system (CDSS) embedded in the registry and based on age, gender, risk factors, registered @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and serologies. Incomplete @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end was defined by the CDSS according to national guidelines. The catch-up @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end plan generated by the CDSS was then implemented during follow-up visits. Results: Of the 328 patients, 152 (46%) were enrolled in 2018. [EN4] The cohort had a median age of 49 years (range 13 to 85) and a male-to-female gender ratio of 2.22. CD4 counts were >200 cells/ mm3 in 296/323 (90%). At enrolment, past HBV infection was documented in 106 (32%) patients, 101 (31%) had been @hit_startimmunised@hit_end and had documented anti-HBS antibodies >100 IU/L [AH6] and 121 (37%) were susceptible or had unknown or incomplete HBV @hit_startimmunity@hit_end. Patients up to date for \u201cbasic @hit_startvaccines@hit_end\u201d (immunisations/@hit_startimmunity@hit_end) were: HBV 206 (63%); HAV 189 (58%); varicella 184 (56%); measles 48 (15%); tetanus 8 (2%); and \u201ccomplementary @hit_startvaccines@hit_end\u201d: pneumococcus 0 (0%). By the first interim @hit_startanalysis@hit_end (1 June 2018), immunisations/ @hit_startimmunity@hit_end rates had increased for all @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases such as tetanus 141, 43% (difference 45.5%); pneumococcus 87, 26.5% (difference 26.5% [EN9]); measles 97, 29.6% (difference 15%); HAV 206, 63% (difference 5%); varicella 187, 57% (difference 0.9%); HBV 207, 63% (difference 0.3%) (Table 1). Conclusions: Despite regular visits, HIV patients in our expert care centre were poorly @hit_startimmunised@hit_end / protected against @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases. The implementation of a systematic evaluation, supported by an expert CDSS generating ready-to-use catchup plans, demonstrated that this did not reflect @hit_startvaccine@hit_end refusal but failure to identify missing immunisations during routine practice."

                                "OBJECTIVE: During influenza season some long-term care (LTC) residents develop influenza despite appropriate resident and health care worker @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Residents are at risk for severe illness during outbreaks. To provide current guidelines for LTC influenza outbreak management, focusing on the pharmacist's role in management, particularly regarding oseltamivir use and potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). METHODS: Literature search was conducted in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Association for Professionals in Infection Control (APIC) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) websites. RESULTS: Preventing influenza and controlling outbreaks necessitates a team of administrators, nurses, pharmacists, physicians and other health care workers to provide appropriate @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, surveillance, infection control, testing, and therapy. The CDC, APIC and CMS recommend antiviral treatment for residents with confirmed or suspected influenza and antiviral chemoprophylaxis for non-ill residents exposed during outbreaks. Oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir were the antivirals recommended for the 2017-2018 season. Oseltamivir has been the prescribed antiviral in LTC despite mixed reports of effectiveness in residents. Treatment should begin within 48 hours of symptom onset or exposure. Oseltamivir dosage should be decreased for patients with creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute and it's not recommended for end stage renal disease patients not on dialysis. The most common oseltamivir prophylaxis/ treatment ADRs reported were nausea, vomiting, headache and pain but neuropsychiatric ADRs of hallucinations, abnormal behavior, confused state, and delirium have occurred, resulting in discontinuation in some cases. Of 10,218 cumulative ADRs reported to the FDA, 2,412 were psychiatric and 2,019 were nervous system; 12% of the cumulative reports involved patients aged 65 and older. CONCLUSION: The LTC pharmacist can play a key role in influenza management by helping identify outbreaks, distributing medication in a timely manner, providing information regarding oseltamivir benefits/risks and dosages, identifying potential ADRs, and suggesting discontinuation when warranted."

The characteristic clinical features of DES include severely emaciated body, normal linear growth and normal or precocious intellectual development, hyperalertness, hyperkinesis, and euphoria usually associated with intracranial sellar-suprasellar mass lesion, usually optico-chiasmatic glioma or hypothalamic mass. DES as a presentation of craniopharyngioma is extremely uncommon but can also occur with brain stem mass. Detailed @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end search for craniopharyngioma associated with DES yielded only six cases in children below 6 years of age. Thus, we reviewed a total of seven cases including previously published six cases and added additional our own case. Overall, the mean age at diagnosis was 4.15 years with male:female ratio of 4:3, the mean time interval between symptom of DES appearance and final diagnosis was 6.6 months. The most commonly observed symptom of DES was weight loss (85). The clinical feature, imaging, and management of such rare syndrome along with pertinent @hit_startliterature@hit_end are briefly @hit_startreviewed@hit_end."
