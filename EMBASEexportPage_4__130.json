                                "Background: Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in Western countries. More than one third of PC patients develop metastatic disease, and the 5-year expected survival in distant disease is about 35%. During the last few years, new treatments have been launched for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Objectives: We aimed to @hit_startreview@hit_end the current @hit_startliterature@hit_end on health economic @hit_startanalysis@hit_end on the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), compare the studies, summarize the findings and make the results available to administrators and decision makers. Methods: A systematic literature search was done for economic evaluations (cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-of-illness, cost-of-drug, and cost-benefit @hit_startanalyses@hit_end). We employed the @hit_startPubMed@hit_end@sup_begin\u00ae@sup_end search engine and searched for publications published between 2012 and 2016. The terms used were \u201cprostate cancer\u201d, \u201cmetastatic\u201d and \u201ccost\u201d. An initial screening of all headlines was performed, selected abstracts were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end, and finally the full papers investigated. Study characteristics, treatment and comparator, country, type of evaluation, perspective, year of value, time horizon, efficacy data, discount rate, total costs and sensitivity @hit_startanalysis@hit_end were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end. The quality was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. Results: A total of 227 publications were detected and screened, 58 selected for full-text assessment and 31 included in the final @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Despite the significant international literature on the treatment of mCRPC, there were only 15 studies focusing on cost-effectiveness @hit_startanalysis@hit_end (CEA). Medical treatment constituted two thirds of the selected studies. Significant costs in the treatment of mCRPC were disclosed. In the pre-docetaxel setting, both abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide were concluded beyond accepted cost/quality-adjusted life year limits. In the docetaxel refractory setting, most studies concluded that enzalutamide was cost-effective and superior to AA. In most studies, cabazitaxel was not recommended, because of high cost. Looking at bone-targeting drugs, generic zoledronic acid (ZA) was recommended. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was @hit_startanalysed@hit_end in three studies, and single fraction radiotherapy was concluded to be cost saving. Radium-223 was documented as beneficial, but costly. The quality of the studies was generally good, but sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, discounting and the measurement of health outcomes were present in less than two thirds of the selected studies. Conclusions: The treatment of mCRPC was associated with significant cost. In the post-docetaxel setting, single fraction radiotherapy and enzalutamide were considered cost-effective in most studies. Generic ZA was the recommended bone-targeting therapy."

                                "Scope Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection reactivation is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with haematologic malignancy and/or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, information on this issue is limited. The scope of this position paper is to provide recommendations on HBV screening, monitoring, prophylaxis, treatment and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the patients described above. Methods These recommendations were developed from one meeting of experts attended by different Italian scientific societies as well as from a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end (of articles published through December 31, 2016) on HBV infection in haematologic patients and in patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation published in the same issue of the journal. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess each recommendation's quality. Questions addressed These recommendations provide the answers to the following questions: (a) HBV screening and monitoring: Who should be screened before chemotherapy? Which screening tests should be used? Should HBV-DNA detection be used to monitor HBV reactivation before starting antivirals? What is the best timeline to monitor HBV reactivation? (b) Prophylaxis in HBsAg-positive patients: Which antiviral drugs should be used to treat HBsAg-positive patients? How long should antiviral prophylaxis be provided to HBsAg-positive patients? (c) Prophylaxis in patients with resolved HBV infection: Which patients with resolved HBV infection should receive antiviral prophylaxis? Which antiviral drug should be used? How long should antiviral prophylaxis be provided? (d) HBV infection management strategy in autologous (auto-HSCT) and allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT): Which HSCT recipients should receive antiviral prophylaxis? Which antiviral drug should be used? How long should antiviral prophylaxis be provided? (e) Choice of antiviral drugs in the treatment of HBV reactivation: Should third-generation anti-HBV drugs be preferred to first- or second-generation antiviral drugs in the treatment of HBV reactivation with or without hepatitis flare in haematologic patients? (f) @hit_startImmunization@hit_end against HBV in patients with haematologic malignancies and/or patients who underwent HSCT: Should these patients be @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end? Which HBV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedule should be adopted? Recommendations Haematologic patients should be screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) plus anti-hepatitis B core protein (HBc), and HBV DNA before chemotherapy. HBV DNA levels should be monitored monthly in all HBV-positive patients who do not receive prophylaxis. HBsAg-positive haematologic patients and those undergoing HSCT should receive third-generation antiviral therapy as prophylaxis. Anti-HBc-positive lymphoma patients and those receiving HSCT should receive antiviral prophylaxis. All HBV-negative haematologic patients should be @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end for HBV. The acquisition of data from well-designed studies is desirable in the near future."

                                "Since 2000, various phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the efficacy of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Comparisons of different ATG formulations are lacking, however. Our aim was to synthesize all published efficacy evidence to enable a comparison of all available formulations of rabbit ATG in the allo-SCT setting. We performed a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end to identify all available phase III RCT evidence. We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end In-Process, and the website www.ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, a trial presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology 2016 was added to include the most recent evidence. We identified a total of 6 RCTs, including 2 formulations: anti\u2013T lymphocyte globulin (ATLG; Grafalon, Neovii Biotech, Lexington, MA) and polyclonal globulin @hit_startimmunized@hit_end with human thymocytes (Thymoglobulin [Thymo]; Genzyme-Sanofi, Cambridge, MA). The evidence was synthesized using a conventional network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end (NMA). The best treatment for preventing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was ATLG, which had a more favorable hazard ratio (HR) compared with standard treatment (chronic GVHD: HR,.42; 95% confidence interval [CI],.31 to.56; acute GVHD grade II-IV: HR,.54; 95% CI,.39 to.73; acute GVHD grade III-IV: HR,.50; 95% CI,.29 to.86), whereas both ATLG and Thymo were at least similarly effective in terms of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) (ATLG: HR,.90; 95% CI,.61 to 1.32; Thymo: HR,.90; 95% CI,.56 to 1.44). Thymo tended to be the better treatment option regarding overall survival (OS) (HR,.86; 95% CI,.59 to 1.26). Our NMA provides the first report of the relative efficacy of all available rabbit ATG formulations in patients undergoing allo-SCT. Until additional data from randomized head-to-head comparisons are available, based on the present @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, ATLG seems to be the best option to prevent chronic and acute GVHD. Both formulations show similar efficacy in terms of TRM, whereas Thymo appears to be the better treatment option in terms of OS."

                                "To review the optimality and safety of different anti-Amyloid-\u03b2(A\u03b2) immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Published randomized controlled trials were comprehensively reviewed from electronic databases (@hit_startCochrane@hit_end library, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startPubmed@hit_end, and Google scholar). Pooled outcomes as mean difference or odds ratio values with 95% confidence interval were reported. The network estimates with confidence and predictive intervals for all pairwise relative effects was evaluated. Optimal intervention was ranked by benefit-risk ratio based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Eleven eligible RCTs from 9 literatures, including 5141 patients and 5 interventions were included. The quality of evidence was rated low in comparisons. For efficacy, in terms of Mini-Mental State Examination, aducanumab and solanezumab are significantly effective than placebo. For safety, in terms of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), bapineuzumab and aducanumab are significantly worse than placebo. There were no significant differences in outcomes of Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale, Disability Assessment for Dementia, Adverse Events, and mortality. Given the clinical therapeutic effects of anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapies for AD, aducanumab and solanezumab improve the cognitive function, while aducanumab and bapineuzumab may increase the risks of ARIA."

                                "Purpose: Maintenance therapy is an effective treatment strategy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aim to investigate whether age would affect the efficacy of maintenance therapy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Materials and methods: Relevant trials were identified by searching electronic databases and conference meetings. Prospective randomized controlled trials assessing maintenance therapy in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC were included. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. Results: A total of 2,724 patients from 5 randomized controlled trials were included for @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, with 897 patients aged $65 years and 1,577 patients aged,65 years. Single-agent maintenance therapy in elderly patients significantly improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43\u20130.98, p=0.04) and OS (HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68\u20130.97, p=0.024) when compared with placebo. In addition, doublet maintenance therapy significantly improved PFS (HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68\u20130.97, p=0.024) in comparison with single-agent maintenance therapy. However, doublet maintenance did not improve OS in comparison with single-agent maintenance therapy (HR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.60\u20131.83, p=0.86). Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that single-agent maintenance therapy in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC offers an improved PFS and OS when compared with placebo. Further trials are recommended to clearly investigate the efficacy of combination maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC in this setting."

                                "Objective @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was used to assess the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment for simple obesity and to provide evidence-based medical data for treating obesity with acupuncture. Methods A comprehensive search of studies on @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials and Chinese databases (Wan Fang,CNKI and VIP) from 1 January 1915 through 30 November 2015 (@hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end search updated through 31 December 2015) was performed. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that used acupuncture and sham acupuncture to treat simple obesity. The effect of acupuncture on simple obesity was measured using body mass index (BMI), body fat mass (BFM), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and body weight (BW). The Jadad scale was used to assess methodological quality. The random effects model was used in the pooled @hit_startanalysis@hit_end to adjust for the heterogeneity of the included studies, and funnel plots were used to examine publication bias. The differences between treatment groups were reported as mean differences (MD). Results Eleven RCTs were selected after all relevant literature from the electronic databases had been screened. There were 338 and 305 participants in the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups, respectively. Auricular and electro acupuncture were both able to reduce BMI in obese patients (MD 0.47 kg/m 2, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.58, p<0.001; MD 0.50 kg/m 2, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.62, p<0.001). BFM change after acupuncture treatment compared with sham treatment was statistically significant (MD 0.66 kg, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.80, p<0.001). There were also significant differences in WC and HC between the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups (MD wc 2.02 cm, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.83, p=0.03; MD HC 2.74 cm, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.27, p=0.0004). BW was not statistically significantly different between the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups (MD 0.60 kg, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.39, p=0.14). Begg's test and funnel plots showed that the potential publication bias of the included studies was very slight (p>0.05). Conclusion Acupuncture for simple obesity appeared to be an effective treatment, but more studies on the safety of acupuncture used to treat simple obesity are required."

                                "This review is focused at exploring the strengths of modern technology driven data compiled in the areas of virus gene sequencing, virus protein structures and their implication to viral diagnosis and therapy. The information for virome @hit_startanalysis@hit_end (viromics) is generated by the study of viral genomes (entire nucleotide sequence) and viral genes (coding for protein). Presently, the study of viral infectious diseases in terms of etiopathogenesis and development of newer therapeutics is undergoing rapid changes. Currently, viromics relies on deep sequencing, next generation sequencing (NGS) data and public domain databases like GenBank and unique virus specific databases. Two commonly used NGS platforms: Illumina and Ion Torrent, recommend maximum fragment lengths of about 300 and 400 nucleotides for @hit_startanalysis@hit_end respectively. Direct detection of viruses in clinical samples is now evolving using these methods. Presently, there are a considerable number of good treatment options for HBV/HIV/HCV. These viruses however show development of drug resistance. The drug susceptibility regions of the genomes are sequenced and the prediction of drug resistance is now possible from 3 public domains available on the web. This has been made possible through advances in the technology with the advent of high throughput sequencing and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end through sophisticated and easy to use software and the use of high speed computers for bioinformatics. More recently NGS technology has been improved with single-molecule real-time sequencing. Here complete long reads can be obtained with less error overcoming a limitation of the NGS which is inherently prone to software anomalies that arise in the hands of personnel without adequate training. The development in understanding the viruses in terms of their genome, pathobiology, transcriptomics and molecular epidemiology constitutes viromics. It could be stated that these developments will bring about radical changes and advancement especially in the field of antiviral therapy and diagnostic virology."

                                "Introduction Since 2000, phase III randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigated the efficacy of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG) in patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, comparisons of different ATG formulations do not exist. Our aim was to synthesize all efficacy evidence, enabling a comparison of all available formulations of rabbit ATG in the allo-SCT setting. Methods We performed a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end to identify all available phase III RCTs using @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end , @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end , @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end in-process, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and the website www.clinical-trials.gov. In addition, meeting abstracts (ASH, ASCO, EHA) were screened to include the most up-to-date evidence. Studies were included if they described a phase III RCT among adult patients who received rabbit globulins in the allo-SCT setting and if they reported results of the following end points of interest: chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD, all grades), acute GVHD II-IV and III+IV, transplant-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS), incidence of relapse and CMV reactivation. The actual network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end (NMA) was performed by using a conventional Bayesian fixed-effect framework and hazard ratios (HR) for most end points while risk ratios (RR) were used for dichotomous outcomes. @hit_startAnalyses@hit_end were done with the R package netmeta. The most common treatment, cyclosporine and methotrexate, was used as reference treatment. Results We identified six phase III RCTs comprising five full publications and one conference abstract between 2001 and 2016, which investigated the following treatment options: 1) Grafalon (Neovii Biotech, Graefelfing, Germany) consisting of polyclonal IgG obtained from hyperimmune sera of rabbits @hit_startimmunized@hit_end with the human Jurkat leukemic T-cell line (ATLG), and 2) Thymoglobulin (Genzyme-Sanofi, Lyon, France), in which @hit_startimmunization@hit_end was done with human thymocytes recovered from patients undergoing cardiac surgery (Thymo). The overall population comprised 871 patients (ATLG: n = 610, and Thymo: n = 261). Population per trial ranged from 27 to 126 patients in the ATG arm and from 25 to 128 patients in the non-ATG arm. The median age of patients ranged from 28 to 49 years. More patients were male, except in the ATG arm of one ATLG trial. To include all trials within one framework, we had to assume: 1) the relative efficacy of ATG versus cyclosporine and methotrexate was identical to that of tacrolimus and methotrexate, which was used as reference treatment in one ATLG trial; 2) no difference in efficacy due to different graft sources or conditioning regimens; 3) no difference in efficacy due to dosage scheme. Figure 1a-f presents the NMA results of the main end points with HRs/RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) versus standard treatment (cyclosporine and methotrexate). Only ATLG was significantly better than standard treatment in preventing GVHD with a HR of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.56) regarding chronic GVHD, and HRs of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.73) and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.86) regarding acute GVHD II-IV and III+IV. The risk of chronic, acute GVHD II-IV and III+IV was reduced by ATLG with 58%, 46% and 50% versus standard treatment. Both ATLG and Thymo were at least similarly effective versus standard treatment and showed no difference in relative efficacy regarding TRM with HRs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.32) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.56 to 1.44). Considering OS, incidence of relapse and CMV reactivation, the NMA yielded at least similar results of both formulations versus standard treatment, with Thymo tending to be better regarding OS with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.26) while resulting less clearly in better relative efficacy regarding relapse with a HR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.24) and CMV reactivation with a RR of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.16). Conclusions Our NMA compared all available rabbit ATG formulations and identified ATLG being the best option to prevent chronic and acute GVHD. Both formulations show similar efficacy in TRM while Thymo tends to be better regarding OS. Since randomized head-to-head comparisons are missing, this NMA provides a complete overview of each formulation's relative efficacy. (Figure Presented)."

                                "Background: Influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is safe and effective for the general population as well as for patients with autoimmune diseases. However, although rare, vasculitis has been reported as an adverse event following influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Object: The aims of this @hit_startliterature review@hit_end were to identify patients who developed vasculitis following influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and to clarify the clinical manifestations of vasculitis in these patients. Methods: Using the @hit_startPubMed@hit_end database and search engine, we performed a search of the English-language literature by combining the term influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with each term for a specific form of vasculitis from January 1966 through April 2016. Results: A total of 65 patients who developed vasculitis after influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were identified from 45 published reports. The majority of patients were elderly, and the patients were predominantly female. The vasculitides included large vessel vasculitis (13 patients), medium vessel vasculitis (2), small vessel vasculitis (42), single organ vasculitis (5), vasculitis associated with systemic disease (1), and vasculitis associated with probable etiology (1). Although the majority of patients achieved complete recovery or remission, there were 3 deaths in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and severe long-term sequelae developed in 3 patients (1 with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 1 with IgA vasculitis and 1 with unclassified small vessel vasculitis). Conclusion: Since vasculitis following influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end has been only rarely reported, routine influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end should not be restricted. However, caution should be required when patients with small vessel vasculitis, especially with ANCA-associated vasculitis following influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end or with post-influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end@hit_start-reactivated@hit_end IgA vasculitis, receive influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end again."

To date, there is no systematic synthesis of evidence regarding strategies to prevent gastrointestinal cancers in developing countries. We aimed to provide a @hit_startsystematic overview@hit_end of studies evaluating strategies for prevention or early detection of the three most common gastrointestinal cancers (gastric, liver and colorectal cancer) in developing countries.",
                                "Methods: We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, Web of Science and WHO Global Index Medicus databases for relevant articles published until October 2016 using combinations of the search terms \"gastrointestinal\", \"digestive system\", \"gastric\", \"liver\", \"colorectal\", \"cancer\", \"prevention\", \"early detection\" and \"developing country\" (including names).",
                                "Results: Overall, 73 articles met the inclusion criteria, providing information on short- and long-term outcomes (up to 30 years) from various intervention studies (\u223c45% randomized). Trials on hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end consistently showed @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy over time and indicated long-term preventive effects on liver cancer incidence that start to become measurable at the population level. Studies on anti-H. pylori treatment suggested a reduction in gastric cancer incidence reaching statistical significance after long-term follow-up, while evidence regarding a preventive effect in persons with precancerous lesions is still inconclusive. The studies regarding colorectal cancer focused on early detection, \u223c90% of which were restricted to intermediate endpoints.",

Important next steps include pooled @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end as far as possible given the heterogeneity between studies as well as implementation research."
