                                "BACKGROUND: The @hit_startvaccine@hit_end system in England underwent radical changes in 2013 following the implementation of the Health and Social Care Act. There have since been multi-year decreases in coverage of many @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Healthcare professionals have reported finding the new system fragmented and challenging. This study aims to produce a logic model of the new system and evaluate the available evidence for interventions to improve coverage. METHODS: We undertook qualitative document @hit_startanalysis@hit_end to develop the logic model using process evaluation methods. We performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end by searching 12 databases with a broad search strategy to identify interventions studied in England conducted between 2006 and 2016 and evaluated their effectiveness. We then compared the evidence base to the logic model. RESULTS: We @hit_startanalysed@hit_end 83 documents and developed a logic model describing the core inputs, processes, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts of the new @hit_startvaccination@hit_end system alongside the programmatic assumptions for each stage. Of 9,615 unique articles, we screened 624 abstracts, 45 full-text articles, and included 16 studies: 8 randomised controlled trials and 8 quasi-experimental studies. Four studies suggest that modifications to the contracting and incentive systems can increase coverage, but changes to other programme inputs (e.g. human or capital resources) were not evaluated. Four multi-component intervention studies modified activities and outputs from within a GP practice to increase coverage, but were part of campaigns or projects. Thus, many potentially modifiable factors relating to routine programme implementation remain unexplored. Reminder/recall systems are under-studied in England; incentive payments to adolescents may be effective; and only two studies evaluated carer information. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base for interventions to increase @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end coverage in the new system in England are limited by a small number of studies and by significant risk of bias. Several areas important to primary care remain unexplored as targets for interventions, especially modification to organisational management."

                                "Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid) virus that has the potential to cause inflammation of the liver. The traditional definition of acute HCV infection is the first six months following infection with the virus. Another commonly used definition of acute HCV infection is the absence of HCV antibody and subsequent seroconversion (presence of HCV antibody in a person who was previously negative for HCV antibody). Approximately 40% to 95% of people with acute HCV infection develop chronic HCV infection, that is, have persistent HCV RNA in their blood. In 2010, an estimated 160 million people worldwide (2% to 3% of the world's population) had chronic HCV infection. The optimal pharmacological treatment of acute HCV remains controversial. Chronic HCV infection can damage the liver. Objectives: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of acute HCV infection through a network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological treatments according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end and instead we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other or versus no intervention using standard @hit_startCochrane@hit_end methodology. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised controlled trials registers to April 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on pharmacological interventions for acute HCV infection. Selection criteria: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with acute HCV infection. We excluded trials which included previously liver transplanted participants and those with other coexisting viral diseases. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with placebo or each other. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used standard methodological procedures expected by @hit_startCochrane@hit_end. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on the available-participant @hit_startanalysis@hit_end with Review Manager 5. We assessed risk of bias according to @hit_startCochrane@hit_end, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential @hit_startAnalysis@hit_end, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: We identified 10 randomised clinical trials with 488 randomised participants that met our inclusion criteria. All the trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. Overall, the evidence for all the outcomes was very low quality evidence. Nine trials (467 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. Three trials (99 participants) compared interferon-alpha versus no intervention. Three trials (90 participants) compared interferon-beta versus no intervention. One trial (21 participants) compared pegylated interferon-alpha versus no intervention, but it did not provide any data for @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. One trial (41 participants) compared MTH-68/B @hit_startvaccine@hit_end versus no intervention. Two trials (237 participants) compared pegylated interferon-alpha versus pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin. None of the trials compared direct-acting antivirals versus placebo or other interventions. The mean or median follow-up period in the trials ranged from six to 36 months. There was no short-term mortality (less than one year) in any group in any trial except for one trial where one participant died in the pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin group (1/95: 1.1%). In the trials that reported follow-up beyond one year, there were no further deaths. The number of serious adverse events was higher with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin than with pegylated interferon-alpha (rate ratio 2.74, 95% CI 1.40 to 5.33; participants = 237; trials = 2; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%). The proportion of people with any adverse events was higher with interferon-alpha and interferon-beta compared with no intervention (OR 203.00, 95% CI 9.01 to 4574.81; participants = 33; trials = 1 and OR 27.88, 95% CI 1.48 to 526.12; participants = 40; trials = 1). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, liver transplantation, decompensated liver disease, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. The proportion of people with chronic HCV infection as indicated by the lack of sustained virological response was lower in the interferon-alpha group versus no intervention (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.76; participants = 99; trials = 3; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%). The differences between the groups were imprecise or not estimable (because neither group had any events) for all the remaining comparisons. Four of the 10 trials (40%) received financial or other assistance from pharmaceutical companies who would benefit from the findings of the research; the source of funding was not available in five trials (50%), and one trial (10%) was funded by a hospital. Authors' conclusions: Very low quality evidence suggests that interferon-alpha may decrease the incidence of chronic HCV infection as measured by sustained virological response. However, the clinical impact such as improvement in health-related quality of life, reduction in cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and liver transplantation has not been reported. It is also not clear whether this finding is applicable in the current clinical setting dominated by the use of pegylated interferons and direct-acting antivirals, although we found no evidence to support that pegylated interferons or ribavirin or both are effective in people with acute HCV infection. We could find no randomised trials comparing direct-acting antivirals with placebo or other interventions for acute HCV infection. There is significant uncertainty in the benefits and harms of the interventions, and high-quality randomised clinical trials are required."

                                "Introduction: Recently, the evidence on efficacy and safety of prophylactic HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end derived from randomized trials was published in the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end database of @hit_startSystematic reviews@hit_end. A summary of this @hit_startCochrane@hit_end review is presented below. Areas covered: Only trials involving mono-, bi-, and quadrivalent HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were included. Trials evaluating the nonavalent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end were excluded since women in the control group received the quadrivalent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Main efficacy outcomes were: histologically confirmed cervical precancer lesions distinguishing those associated with @hit_startvaccine@hit_end HPV types and any cervical precancer. Exposure groups were: women aged: 15\u201326 or 24\u201345 years being initially negative for high-risk HPV (hrHPV) or negative for the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end types and women unselected by HPV status. Expert commentary: All evaluated @hit_startvaccines@hit_end offered excellent protection against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or 3 (CIN2 or CIN3) and adenocarcinoma in situ associated with HPV16/18 infection in young women who were not initially infected with hrHPV or HPV16/18. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end efficacy was lower when all women regardless of HPV DNA status at enrollment were included. In young women, HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end protected also against any cervical precancer but the magnitude of protection was lower than against HPV16/18 associated cervical precancer. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end efficacy was lower in mid-adult (aged 24\u201345 years) women. No protection against cervical precancer was found in mid-adult women unselected by HPV DNA status at enrollment. Trials were not empowered to address protection against cervical cancer. Occurrence of severe adverse events or adverse pregnancy outcomes was not significantly higher in recipients of HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end than in women included in the control arms."

                                "Objectives: To compare the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalization rate, hospital length of stay (LOS), and need for assisted ventilation in children aged <2 years with Down syndrome and those without Down syndrome. Study design: @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end databases were searched from inception up to December 2017. Studies that provided data on RSV-related hospitalization in children aged <2 years with Down syndrome and those without Down syndrome were included. Data were independently extracted in pairs by 2 reviewers and synthesized with random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Results: In 10 studies including a total of 1 748 209 children, 12.6% of the children with Down syndrome (491 of 3882) were hospitalized with RSV infection. The presence of Down syndrome was associated with a significantly higher risk of RSV-related hospitalization (relative risk [RR], 6.06; 95% CI, 4.93-7.45; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 65%; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE], moderate). RSV-related LOS (mean difference, 2.11 days; 95% CI, 1.47-2.75 days; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%; GRADE, low), and the need for assisted ventilation (RR, 5.82; 95% CI, 1.81-18.69; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 84%; GRADE, low). Children with Down syndrome without congenital heart disease (RR, 6.31; 95% CI, 4.83-8.23; GRADE, moderate) also had a significantly higher risk of RSV-related hospitalization. The risk of RSV-related hospitalization remained significant in the subgroup of children aged <1 year (RR, 6.25; 95% CI, 4.71-8.28; GRADE, high). Conclusion: RSV-related hospitalization, hospital LOS, and the need for assisted ventilation are significantly higher in children with Down syndrome aged <2 years compared with those without Down syndrome. The results should prompt reconsideration of the need for routine RSV prophylaxis in children with Down syndrome up to 2 years of age."

                                "Q fever caused by the gram negative bacteria, Coxiella burnetii, is an occupational hazard for those who live and work in rural settings and those who are in contact with animals, especially abattoir and slaughterhouse workers. Australia is the only country to register a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to prevent Q fever (Q-vax\u00ae, Seqirus, Australia) that is used in high risk populations. Seroprevalence studies conducted to determine the burden of Q fever (C. burnetii infection) in different settings have demonstrated high levels of heterogeneity with estimates of the percent positive ranging from 30% to 70%. There is a need for a more systematic evaluation of the findings of these studies in order to provide summary estimates of the seroprevalence in different settings. We searched for published articles using @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end-@hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and Scopus databases using search terms obtained from an initial review of published reports of recent Q fever outbreaks. Data on the seroprevalence of C. burnetii infection (Q fever) was extracted from the selected studies and a random effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was performed with stratification by outbreak status, year, country and serological techniques used. Results were visualised with a forest plot with 95% CI and measures of heterogeneity (I@sup_begin2@sup_end) for the random effects model. A total of 19 articles that met the search criteria were included. The reported seroprevalence rate ranged from 4.7% to 91.7% among abattoir and slaughterhouse workers. No inter-group heterogeneity was observed (p = 0.956), supporting the pooling of all studies into one pooled measure. The pooled estimate of seropositivity for C. burnetii infection in people working in abattoirs and slaughterhouses was 26% (95% CI: 18\u201335%) regardless of the evidence of an \u201coutbreak\u201d, the time of year or country. Seropositivity for C burnetii was independent of a person's age and years of occupational experience. Within abattoirs and slaughterhouses, slaughtering of cattle, sheep and goats are the most important risk factors associated with seropositivity and for those who showed over symptoms upon infection. We recommend that @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programmes are directed towards people employed in the meat processing industry to mitigate the significant health and economic impacts of Q fever."

                                "The field of cancer immunotherapy has been revolutionized with the use of immune checkpoint blockade antibodies such as anti-programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Significant clinical benefits are observed in different cancer types with these treatments. While considerable efforts are made in augmenting tumor-specific T cell responses with these therapies, other immunotherapies that actively stimulate endogenous anti-tumor T cells and generating long-term memory have received less attention. Given the high cost of cancer immunotherapies especially with chimeric antigen receptor T cells, not many patients will have access to such treatments. The next-generation of cancer immunotherapy could entail in vivo cancer @hit_startvaccination@hit_end to activate both the innate and adaptive anti-tumor responses. This could potentially be achieved via in vivo targeting of dendritic cells which are an indispensable link between the innate and adaptive immunities. Dendritic cells highly expressed toll-like receptors for recognizing and eliminating pathogens. Synthetic toll-like receptors agonists could be synthesized at a low cost and have shown promise in preclinical and clinical trials. As different subsets of human dendritic cells exist in the immune system, activation with different toll-like receptor agonists could exert profound effects on the quality and magnitude of anti-tumor T cell responses. Here, we reviewed the different subsets of human dendritic cells. Using published preclinical and clinical cancers studies available on @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, we discussed the use of clinically approved and emerging toll-like receptor agonists to activate dendritic cells in vivo for cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we searched www.clinicaltrials.gov and summarized the active cancer trials evaluating toll-like receptor agonists as an adjuvant."

                                "Objective: The goal is to establish dialogue and determine the needs and skill levels of adolescence. This concerns sexuality, the prevention of STIs, the informed choice of contraception to avoid an unplanned pregnancy. M\u00e9thodes: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end based on @hit_startliterature@hit_end about contraception AND teenagers was performed using @hit_startPubmed@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end, national and international recommendations. Results: The surveillance of the teenager contraception must integrate more specifically: global health with a stability of weight and corpulence, a sufficient calcium intake, the prevention of the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against HPV. The 1st consultations with adolescent girls are an essential moment for dialogue in order to develop sexuality education. Main themes are: prevention of STIs with the use of condoms, detection of situations of precariousness or sexual abuse, and finally adherence to treatment to avoid unplanned pregnancy. Use of condoms associated with regular contraception is essential to assure a barrier against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (NP1). To preserve the patient confidentiality, the patient is received alone (Grade B). She must be reassured about respect of anonymity and availability of free treatment. Clinical examination collects weight, height, BMI and blood pressure (Grade C). It is important to give them the choice of contraceptive method and provide objective information on the different contraceptive methods (NP2). If there are any contraindications, when the first prescription is a pill, it must be a 1st or 2nd generation pill with levonorgestrel. For some experts, it would be important to prescribe a pill at 30 \u03bcg EE for better efficacy in case of forgetfulness in very young patients and for the good maintenance of bone mineralization (NP4). Information on long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, is essential. These contraceptive methods have proved their efficacy and their place in the first intention. (NP1). Conclusion: Prescribing contraception to a teenage girl requires the adaptation of the best treatment to her needs to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. This requires good information on prevention of STIs and on different methods of contraception in a confidence climate."

                                "The combined health and economic impact of Taenia solium urges for control and, if possible, elimination of this neglected parasitic zoonosis. Up till now there is still no consensus about the most cost-effective and feasible approaches for control. The objective of this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end is to identify and summarize the evidence in English scientific literature on the control and elimination of T. solium since 2014, based on the rapidly evolving field of evidence on control and elimination of T. solium. The search resulted in the identification of 458 records of which 31 were included, covering 13 field trials and 18 articles containing experimental data, mathematical models, and other information directly relevant the control of T. solium. Recent field studies confirm that combinations of interventions or multiple rounds are more successful in obtaining rapid reductions in transmission and parasite occurrence, with the quick impact of the combination of human and pig treatment confirmed in a South Asian and Peruvian context. Moreover, elimination of transmission through a one-year intensive program, combining human and pig treatment/@hit_startvaccination@hit_end was described in a Peruvian study. Recent studies also provide more data on the positive impact of specific health education, as well as newly developed electronic educational tools, providing opportunities for area specific community-engaged participatory interventions. Once control has been achieved, monitoring of migration of both potentially infected people and pigs from outside the control area is important for sustained disease control."

                                "Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) are used in many malignancies as @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to induce @hit_startimmunity@hit_end against specific cancer antigens. The role of DCs in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is not determined. In this study, the proportion of mCRPC patients with clinically significant response to targeted therapy by DCs pulsed with prostate-specific membrane antigen was evaluated, and the possible adverse effects of this modality were investigated. Methods: Major databases were searched up to Feb 2017, to identify studies in which the antitumor efficacy of DCs pulsed with the extracellular portion of PSMA was studied for the treatment of mCRPC. Data were collected by two reviewers and @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end using Comprehensive @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-Analysis@hit_end software, version 2.0. Findings: Our study consisted of 6 nonrandomized prospective (cohort) trials, overall reporting on 153 mCRPC patients. The event rate that is the representative of fraction of patients showing antitumor response was 0.43 (95% confidence interval = 0.355\u20130.512; P = 0.097). No significant between-study heterogeneity or inconsistency was detected (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 5.47; Q = 5; P = 0.382). Our study failed to demonstrate a significant therapeutic efficacy for DCs in mCRPC. However, no significant adverse effects were seen."

                                "Objective: To review the epidemiology, natural history, evaluation, and prevention of rubella infection during pregnancy. This will aid obstetric care providers in counseling their patients regarding potentially devastating effects on the developing fetus and the importance of @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end susceptible women as appropriate. Outcomes: Outcomes evaluated include fetal rubella infection, maternal seroconversion and response to rubella-containing @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Evidence: @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end databases were searched for articles in English on subjects related to rubella infection during pregnancy betweenn 1985 and 2017. Results were restricted to @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Other (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. Valuation methods: The quality of the evidence is rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). Recommendations for practice are ranked according to the method described in this Report. Guideline update: The guideline will be reviewed 5 years after publication to decide if an update is required. However, if important new evidence is published prior to the 5-year cycle, the review process may be accelerated for a more rapid update of some recommendations Sponsor: Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Recommendations: 1 Screening for rubella serostatus is recommended as part of standard prenatal screening if a pregnant woman has no record of rubella past @hit_startimmunity@hit_end and no proof of @hit_startimmunization@hit_end against rubella (III-B).2 Since the effects of rubella infection in pregnancy vary with the gestational age at the time of infection, accurate gestational dating should be established, as well as timing of rubella infection, as they are critical to counselling (II-3A).3 In a pregnant woman exposed to rubella or who develops signs or symptoms of rubella or whose fetus presents ultrasound anomalies compatible with congenital rubella syndrome, serological testing for rubella immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G should be performed to determine immune status and risk of congenital rubella syndrome (III-A).4 Women should be counselled about the possible risk of vertical transmission and informed regarding the option of pregnancy termination, especially if primary infection occurs prior to 16 weeks gestation (III-A).5 Rubella @hit_startimmunization@hit_end should not be administered in pregnancy but may be safely given postpartum, as long as there is no contraindication to receive a live @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (i.e., systemic immunosuppression). Consider delaying @hit_startvaccination@hit_end if the woman received any immunoglobulin-containing preparations, including Rh immunoglobulin or intravenous immune globulin, or blood products during pregnancy or the peripartum period, as there is potential for reduced @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness (III-B).6 Women who have been inadvertently @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end in early pregnancy or who become pregnant immediately following @hit_startvaccination@hit_end can be reassured that there have been no cases of congenital rubella syndrome documented in these situations (III-B).7 Women wishing to conceive should be counselled and encouraged to have their rubella antibody status determined if no record of rubella past @hit_startimmunity@hit_end and no proof of @hit_startimmunization@hit_end are available and undergo rubella @hit_startvaccination@hit_end if needed (III-B)."
