                                "Background: Prevalence of viral hepatitis B, C and D is low in Germany. However, the burden of disease can be high among vulnerable groups. There is currently no overview of the scientific evidence regarding epidemiological situation in the general population and vulnerable groups in Germany. We performed a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end to understand the baseline epidemiological situation in the light of viral hepatitis elimination goals in Germany, and to identify knowledge gaps and research needs. Methods: The protocol of the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was prepared fol-lowing PRISMA statement guidelines and in line with the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Collaboration. Relevant search terms were used to identify eligible studies reporting on burden of disease (prevalence, incidence, transmission routes, distribution of genotypes, co-infections, quality of life and outcome of infection) and management (@hit_startvaccination@hit_end, diagnosis, therapy and liver transplantation) of viral hepatitis B, C and D. We searched the online databases @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Europe PMC, Scopus and Base Bielefeld and CC Med for references published between January 2005 and March 2017. Only studies with original data were included. References were screened for relevance and eligibility by two independent reviewers; first on the level of article title and abstract, later on the level of the full text. Results: We identified in total 10.956 references; 601 full text ref-erences were identified in first screening of which 90 were eligible for extraction. As of 19@sup_beginth@sup_end of February 2018 we have extracted 83 references (63, 57 and 10 describing hepatitis B, C and D, respectively) representing 302 outcomes: 221 on burden of disease (94 prevalence, 7 incidence, 22 transmission routes, 15 distribution of genotypes, 34 co-infections, 66 outcome of infection, 3 quality of life) and 81 described management (33 @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage, 10 di-agnosis, 23 therapy, 15 liver transplantation). The population groups include the general population, a range of clinical populations, intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, healthcare workers and migrants. Compilation and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of extracted results is ongoing. Conclusions: We created a comprehensive evidence-based over-view on the current epidemiological situation of viral hepatitis in Germany. Based on ongoing @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of the extracted data we will be able to identify knowledge gaps for further research and establish baseline for future monitoring of viral hepatitis elimination goals in Germany."

                                "Background and aims: @hit_startVaccinations@hit_end are often the most effective tool against some diseases known to mankind. Case reports of optic neuritis (ON) following @hit_startvaccination@hit_end can lead to distrust in the safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, therefore it is important to gather existing knowledge on @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and ON in order not to confuse temporal and causal relations. Methods: This study is a @hit_startliterature review@hit_end on the role of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end regarding the risk of developing ON. Results: A @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end on the database @hit_startPubMed@hit_end. Conclusion: The summarised results of the studies did not raise sufficient evidence to back up a positive association between ON and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against HBV, HAV, HPV, MMR, influenza, variola, varicella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, anthrax, meningococcal, pneumococcal or typhoid. However, since the identified studies of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and ON were limited, a complete exclusion of correlation cannot be made."

                                "Background @hit_startVaccination@hit_end is the most cost-effective strategy in disease prevention but remains an ambiguous area in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Most patients will require immunomodulators/biologics at some time point; hence there exists a large unmet need for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Guidelines are not strict around the world while western guidelines are not pragmatic in Indian population; extrapolating may not be cost-effective. However, certain diseases are uncommon in Asia-Pacific countries including India. We gathered details on the recommendation for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in IBD around the world, explored the appropriateness, and calculated the probable cost of implementing them. Methods A computer-assisted publication search of @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end was performed on August 9, 2017, to identify guidelines and/or recommendations (in English) from the year 1980-2017 for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in IBD which were later critiqued. Current Index of Medical Specialties (August 2017) was used for costing expressed in Indian Rupee (INR) and UK pound sterling (<). Results This narrative review included nine articles, all highlighting the need to assess immunosuppressed state prior to administering live @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, while inactivated can be used safely. Hepatitis A, Meningococcal, Japanese encephalitis and Yellow fever @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (for travellers) could perhaps be withheld in Indian patients with IBD since their occurrence is low. Hepatitis B, Varicella Zoster (VZ), pneumococcal HPV and yearly influenza shots look appropriate; rest should be decided on clinical wisdom based on the type of flare (MMR, DPT if unvaccinated). Majority of the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end have been available after 1980, patients born prior might need additional protection. The total cost of @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end per patient with IBD in the Indian context is INR 48016 (< 534). Conclusions The timing of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is crucial; patients with IBD need it regardless of age. Screening is necessary, but some can be excluded, rest decided on local disease prevalence. The disease should be in remission, medication optimised and health care maintenance updated. The need for specific @hit_startvaccines@hit_end should currently follow national guidelines. Proposed strategy preferably would be the development of Indian guidelines for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in IBD. The cost of VZ pneumococcal and Hepatitis A/B combination @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is colossally highlighting the need for prescribing cost-effective alternate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end brands when available."

                                "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a vector transmitted, arthropod-borne viral disease. People around the globe, especially pregnant females are more prone to it. Various neurological and ophthalmological congenital abnormalities make it an epidemic in Central and South Americas as well as Pacific regions. Therefore, the present review, by considering available literature, aims to evaluate the link between ZIKV infection and maternofetal damage. We used a number of electronic databases (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct) to identify the relevant published studies. Of 200 articles found initially, 144 were selected for additional review. Subsequently, 69 articles were finally selected. ZIKV is a life threatening fetal infection. It can easily encounter developing fetus through maternal circulation. Large numbers of fetal mortalities and adult morbidities have been reported till date. WHO has reported cases of ZIKV associated fetus neural damage from 29 countries in its recent report of 2017. Though the exact mechanism of maternofetal ZIKV transmission is still inconspicuous, it is evident that in the 1st trimester the risk of developing microcephaly is at its peak, thus, maximizing the risk of various congenital anomalies. The lack of proper therapeutic and preventive measurements makes it more deleterious."

                                "Context: Attention and taking care for communicable diseases are very important in mass gatherings. The aim of this study was to illustrate an overview about infectious diseases distribution among pilgrims in Hajj. Evidence Acquisition: This was a review article, in which the authors used all papers, which were indexed in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Irandoc from 2000 to 2015. The following key words were searched in the databases: hajj, infectious diseases, emerging and re-emerging diseases, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, and chemoprevention. Three hundred and fifty-four papers were found and their contents were subsequently reviewed after abstract screening. Results: The results showed that the most frequent diseases in Hajj were respiratory infections. The most frequent causes of respiratory infections were upper respiratory viral infections and bacterial respiratory infections, respectively. In the recent years, emerging and reemerging diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome due to coronaviruses (MERS-CoV), and Ebola have imposed many stresses on the pilgrims and health policy managers. Conclusions: In this study, the researchers offered some effective recommendations for @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end, chemoprophylaxis, and other preventive measures for pilgrims."

                                "Background: Paracetamol may be used as an antipyretic agent for the treatment of fever, as well as an @hit_startanalgesic@hit_end in the treatment of mild to moderate pain post-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end in infants. The use of paracetamol during fever may be or may not be recommended since it may alter the natural human body immune response, although it may reduce fever and fussiness. Objectives: The aims of this study are to describe the effectiveness of breastfeeding in reducing pain and paracetamol in reducing fever and pain post infant @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods: Data sources and study selection was conducted by electronic searching of six databases. Manual reference checks of all articles on paracetamol and breastfeeding post infant @hit_startvaccination@hit_end published in the English language between 1978 and 2017. Two levels of screening were used on 9614 citations, which include screening of abstracts and titles followed by full text screening. The data synthesis were tabulated into study characteristics, quality, and effects. Results: @hit_startSystematic review@hit_end of breastfeeding included three studies from 9614 database searches found significant benefit from breastfeeding in pain scores and the duration of crying, as well as behavioural changes. None of the studies stated the detriment of breastfeeding before, during, and after @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. @hit_startSystematic review@hit_end of paracetamol effectiveness included four studies from 1177 database searches found significant benefit from prophylaxis paracetamol in fever, one study found significant benefit from prophylaxis paracetamol in fussiness, and one study's results were found to be not significant. Two studies on evaluating the safety of prophylactic paracetamol in 2009 found that antibody responses to several antigens were significantly reduced, and the other study in 1988 found that antibody titres to DTP bacteria of placebo and PCM did not differ significantly. Conclusions: The relevancy of giving paracetamol post all types of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end may be questionable. Breastfeeding before, during, and after @hit_startimmunization@hit_end are recommended for pain reduction and are proven effective. Further research is required in deciding if paracetamol is to be of rational use following infant @hit_startimmunization@hit_end."

                                "Objectives: A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Task Force was established to update the recommendations for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) published in 2011. Methods: Following the latest version of the EULAR Standardised Operating Procedures (SOP), three @hit_startsystematic literature reviews@hit_end were conducted to present the new evidence published between 2009-2017 regarding the prevalence of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end preventable diseases among patients with AIIRD, the efficacy and safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end recommended for adults, and the effect of disease modifying drugs on the response to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. After the presentation of the new evidence to the Task Force, overarching principles and recommendations were formulated. Evidence was graded in categories I-IV, the strength of recommendations was graded in categories A-D, and Delphi voting was applied to determine the level of agreement between the experts of the Task Force. Results: A total of 6 overarching principles and 9 recommendations were formulated. The first two overarching principles focus on the responsibility of the treating physician for a yearly assessment of the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status of AIIRD patients. An individualised @hit_startvaccination@hit_end program should be suggested and explicitly discussed with all patients. The next overarching principles address the timing of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Preferably patients are @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end during stable disease and prior to planned immunosuppression, in particular prior to B-cell depleting treatment. Non-live @hit_startvaccines@hit_end can be safely provided to AIIRD patients under immunomodulating treatments, whereas the administration of live attenuated @hit_startvaccines@hit_end should be avoided under immunomodulating treatment, with the possible exceptions of herpes zoster and MMR. Recommendations 1 to 7 refer to the administration of specific @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Influenza and pneumococcal (a combination of PCV 13 and PPSV23) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end should be strongly considered for all patients with AIIRD. Herpes zoster, human papilloma virus, hepatitis A and B, yellow fever, and tick-borne encephalitis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end should be considered in AIIRD patients at risk. Newly formulated recommendations 8 and 9 address the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end approach to household members and newborns of patients with AIIRDs. Immunocompetent household members of patients with AIIRD should be encouraged to receive @hit_startvaccines@hit_end according to national guidelines with the exception of oral poliomyelitis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Live attenuated @hit_startvaccines@hit_end should be avoided during the first 6 months of life in newborns of mothers treated with biologics during the second half of pregnancy Conclusions: The 2017 EULAR recommendations provide an up-to-date guidance on the management of @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end in patients with AIIRDs. The dissemination of the data to health professionals and patients and implementation of the recommendations will help to prevent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end preventable diseases in the AIIRD population."

                                "Background: Serious infections are a major concern for patients considering biologic agents for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Evidence from @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end is consistent with an increased risk of serious infections with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs);1 however, long-term real-life studies are scarce and controversial. Objectives: To determine the risk of serious infections (i.e., need of hospitalisation) in patients affected by RA, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS), treated by bDMARDs in the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia, approximately 1,200,000 inhabitants. Methods: The regional health information system was used as the source of data. Administrative data from the hospital discharge records database, the medical prescription database, and the database of exemptions from medical charges were linked at the individual patient level through an anonymous univocal stochastic key. A cohort of patients diagnosed for RA, PsA or AS from 2006 to 2015 was identified from specific national exemption codes (006, 045, 054) and followed up to either the end of 2015, or hospitalisation with the main discharge diagnosis of infection, as ICD-9-CM codes, or death, or change of residency out of the Region. Multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of hospitalisation associated with bDMARDs and adjusting for age, sex, Charlson's comorbidity index, calendar year, prescription of steroids and of csDMARDs. Use of bDMARDs was treated as a time-dependent variable. Results: Overall, the cohort consisted of 5596 subjects: 3216 (57,5%) with RA, 1702 (30,4%) with PsA, and 678 (12,1%) with AS. Of them, 940 patients (16,8%) had received at least one prescription of a bDMARDs during the study period. During follow-up, 193 (3,4%) subjects were admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of infection. The most frequent infections were upper and lower respiratory tract infections (86/193, 44,5%), followed by sepsis (19/193, 9,8%), and soft tissue and skin infections (16/193, 8,3%). After adjusting for the abovementioned variables, when starting a bDMARD, the risk of infections was significantly increased, with an observed increased risk of almost 2-fold by the time of the bDMARD prescription (HR 1.694, 95% CI 1.158-2.478, p=0,0066). Compared with patients<40 years if age, the elderly (>/=65 years) showed a much higher risk of infections (HR 3.919, 95% CI 2.286-6.716, p<0,0001). @hit_startAnalyses@hit_end stratified by disease indicated that RA, PsA, and AS patients starting biologic medications have increased risk of infection. Conclusions: By integrating the information coming from ten-year administrative databases, RA, PsA and AS patients starting bDMARDs are at high risk of serious infections. This risk is much higher in the elderly. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections are the most common infections, supporting the prevention policies by @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for influenza viruses and Str. pneumoniae, in particular in the elderly population."

Yet, these current IL-4 DC @hit_startvaccines@hit_end do not encompass the ideal stimulatory triggers for innate gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cell anti-tumor activity. Promoting type 1 cytotoxic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in patients with AML is, however, most interesting, considering these unconventional T cells are primed for rapid function and exert meaningful control over AML. Indeed, a recent @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of gene expression data from over 18000 cancers, including hematological malignancies, identified the presence of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to be the most significant factor associated with favorable prognosis (Gentles et al. Nature Medicine 2015). We have recently shown that our IL-15 DCs are capable of recruiting various cytotoxic effector cells including \u03b3\u03b4 T cells suggesting the possibility of interaction (Van Acker et al. Oncotarget 2017). Aims: In the current study, we characterized the IL-15 DC-mediated \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation on both the phenotypic and functional level and investigated the potential mechanisms involved. Methods: Human monocyte-derived DCs were generated according to our rapid DC culture protocol involving IL-15 for DC differentiation and a Toll-like receptor agonist for DC maturation. These IL-15 DCs were tested in terms of their capacity to boost type 1 cytotoxic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Results: In this work we demonstrate that IL-15 DCs have the capacity to enhance the anti-tumoral functions of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. IL-15 DCs of healthy donors and of AML patients in remission induce the upregulation of cytotoxicity-associated and co-stimulatory molecules on the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell surface, but not of co-inhibitory molecules, incite \u03b3\u03b4 T cell proliferation and stimulate their interferon-\u03b3 production in the presence of blood cancer cells and phosphoantigens. Moreover, the innate cytotoxic capacity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is significantly enhanced upon interaction with IL-15 DCs, both towards leukemic cell lines and allogeneic primary AML blasts. Finally, we address soluble IL-15 secreted by IL-15 DCs as the main mechanism behind the IL-15 DCmediated \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation. Summary/Conclusion: These results indicate that the application of IL-15-secreting DC subsets could render DC-based anti-cancer @hit_startvaccines@hit_end more effective through, among others, the involvement of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the antileukemic immune response."

                                "Background:No evidence synthesis available to date assessed the role of newly studied antiviral agents on cytomegalovirus (CMV) after transplantation. Aims: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, conventional @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end and network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the role of antiviral prophylaxis on CMV after allogeneic hematopoieticcell transplantation, and to compare each agent's relative efficacy. Methods: We performed a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end using @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end\u00ae, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end\u00ae in-process, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and the website www.clinical- trials.gov. In addition, meeting abstracts (ASH, ASCO, EBMT, EHA, BMT Tandem) were screened to include the most recent evidence. Primary objectives were CMV disease and infection. Survival and serious adverse events were considered as secondary end points. The @hit_startanalysis@hit_end consisted of two steps, the first step being the computation of the conventional @hit_startmetaanalysis@hit_end while the second step was the actual network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were generated using a random-effects model in R (package @hit_startmeta@hit_end). The GRADE approach was ussed to assess quality of evidence. Results: Fifteen trials used seven different treatment options reporting on a total of 3924 patients: (1) acyclovir, (2) ganciclovir, (3) maribavir, (4) brincidofovir, (5) letermovir, (6) @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, and (7) valacyclovir. Twelve trials compared antiviral prophylaxis versus placebo while three trials compared different antiviral agents. Antiviral prophylaxis compared with control significantly prevented CMV disease (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.90) in the conventional @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Overall, antiviral prophylaxis reduced the risk for CMV disease with 34%. Ganciclovir was the only agent which significantly reduced the risk for CMV disease showing the most favorable RR of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.62). The use of ganciclovir provided the probability of 92% of being the best treatment option (high quality of evidence). Regarding CMV infection, antiviral prophylaxis compared with control significantly reduced the incidence of infection (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.79). Ganciclovir and letermovir significantly prevented CMV infection showing the most favorable RRs of 0.34 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.91) and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.93). The use of either ganciclovir or letermovir provided probabilities of 83% and 73% of being the best options (low quality of evidence). Regarding survival and safety, antiviral treatment appeared to reduce the risk for death (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.06) while prophylaxis showed no impact on the risk for serious adverse events compared with any control condition with a RR of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.27). Across the network, the risk for death at 24 weeks was significantly reduced by letermovir (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.98) as well as acyclovir (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.95) leading to probabilities of 82% (letermovir) and 80% (acyclovir) of being the best treatment options. In terms of safety, letermovir showed the best relative efficacy compared with all other antiviral agents with a RR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.32) and was thus at least similar in comparison with placebo with the probability being 76% that letermovir shows the best risk-benefit profile (moderate quality of evidence). Summary and Conclusions: Cytomegalovirus disease and infection could be significantly reduced by antiviral prophylaxis in hematopoietic-cell transplantation. While ganciclovir and letermovir appeared to be the best options for CMV prophylaxis, only letermovir showed the best risk-benefit ratio."
