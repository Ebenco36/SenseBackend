                                "Background: Acute splenic sequestration crises are a complication of sickle cell disease, with high mortality rates and frequent recurrence in survivors of first attacks. Splenectomy and blood transfusion, with their consequences, are the mainstay of long-term management used in different parts of the world. Objectives: To assess whether splenectomy (total or partial), to prevent acute splenic sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease, improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with sickle cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusions. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional trials were sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search strategy. Date of the most recent search: 06 December 2012. Selection criteria: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing splenectomy (total or partial) to prevent recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises with no treatment or blood transfusions in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. Main results: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. Authors' conclusions: Splenectomy, if full, will prevent further sequestration and if partial, may reduce the recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises. However, there is a lack of evidence from trials showing that splenectomy improves survival and decreases morbidity in people with sickle cell disease. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to December 2012. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published."

                                "Background: Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It occurs in newborn infants born to mothers who do not have sufficient circulating antibodies to protect the infant passively, by transplacental transfer. Prevention may be possible by the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of pregnant or non-pregnant women, or both, with tetanus toxoid, and the provision of clean delivery services. Tetanus toxoid consists of a formaldehyde-treated toxin which stimulates the production of antitoxin. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of tetanus toxoid, administered to women of childbearing age or pregnant women, to prevent cases of, and deaths from, neonatal tetanus. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2012), The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library (2012, Issue 10), @hit_startPubMed@hit_end (1966 to 31October 2012), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to 31 October 2012). We also used the results from handsearching and consultations with manufacturers and authors. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of tetanus toxoid in pregnant women or women of childbearing age on numbers of neonatal tetanus cases and deaths. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality, and extracted data. Main results: Two trials (10,560 infants) were included. It should be noted that these trials are very old,1966 and 1980 respectively, and one trial randomised exclusively non-pregnant women. The main outcomes were measured on infants born to a subset of those randomised women who became pregnant during the course of the studies. One study (1919 infants) assessed the effectiveness of tetanus toxoid in comparison with influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in preventing neonatal tetanus deaths. After a single dose, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.24), and the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness was 43%. With a two- or three-dose course, the RR was 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.30); @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness was 98%. No effect was detected on causes of death other than tetanus. The RR of cases of neonatal tetanus after at least one dose of tetanus toxoid was 0.20 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.40); @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness was 80%. Another study, involving 8641 children, assessed the effectiveness of tetanus-diptheria toxoid in comparison with cholera toxoid in preventing neonatal mortality after one or two doses. The RR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.82); @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness was 32%. In preventing deaths at four to 14 days, the RR was 0.38 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.55), and @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness 62% (95% CI 45% to 73%). Authors' conclusions: Available evidence supports the implementation of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end practices on women of childbearing age or pregnant women in communities with similar, or higher, levels of risk of neonatal tetanus, to the two study sites. More information is needed on possible interference of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end by malaria chemoprophylaxis on the roles of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency, and on the quality of tetanus toxoid production and storage."

                                "Background: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and premature death worldwide. Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness. Objectives: How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits? Methods: The overview is restricted to @hit_startCochrane@hit_end reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments. We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Database of @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end (CDSR) in The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, for any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events. Main results: We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The @hit_startanalyses@hit_end covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96). Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46). Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56). Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose-dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin's UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments. Authors' conclusions: NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use. Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine's potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT."

                                "Background: During pregnancy, a Rhesus-negative (Rh-negative) woman may develop antibodies if her fetus is Rh-positive, which can cause fetal morbidity or mortality in following pregnancies, if untreated. Objectives: To assess the effects of administering anti-D immunoglobulin (Ig) after spontaneous miscarriage in a Rh-negative woman, with no anti-D antibodies. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2012). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) in Rh-negative women without antibodies who were given anti-D Ig following spontaneous miscarriage compared with no treatment or placebo treatment following spontaneous miscarriage as control. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors extracted data and checked it for accuracy. Main results: We included one RCT, involving 48 women who had a miscarriage between eight to 24 weeks of gestation. Of the 19 women in the treatment group, 14 had therapeutic dilatation & curettage (D&C) and five had spontaneous miscarriage; of the 29 women in the control group, 25 had therapeutic D&C and four had spontaneous miscarriage. The treatment group received 300 \u03bcg anti-D Ig intramuscular injection and were compared with a control group who received 1 cc homogenous gamma globulin placebo. This review's primary outcomes (development of a positive Kleihauer Betke test (a test that detects fetal cells in the maternal blood; and development of RhD alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy) were not reported in the included study. Similarly, none of the review's secondary outcomes were reported in the included study: the need for increased surveillance for suspected fetal blood sampling and fetal transfusions in subsequent pregnancies, neonatal morbidity such as neonatal anaemia, jaundice, bilirubin encephalopathy, erythroblastosis, prematurity, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) in subsequent pregnancies, maternal adverse events of anti-D administration including anaphylactic reaction and blood-borne infections. The included study did report subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies in three women in the treatment group and six women in the control group. However, due to the small sample size, the study failed to show any difference in maternal sensitisation or development of Rh alloimmunisation in the subsequent pregnancies. Authors' conclusions: There are insufficient data available to evaluate the practice of anti-D administration in an unsensitised Rh-negative mother after spontaneous miscarriage. Thus, until high-quality evidence becomes available, the practice of anti-D Immunoglobulin prophylaxis after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rh alloimmunisation cannot be generalised and should be based on the standard practice guidelines of each country."

                                "Background: During pregnancy, a Rhesus negative (Rh-negative) woman may develop antibodies when her fetus is Rhesus positive (Rh-positive). These antibodies may harm Rh-positive babies. Objectives: To assess the effects of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin on the incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation when given to Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012). Selection criteria: Randomised trials in Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies given anti-D after 28 weeks of pregnancy, compared with no treatment, placebo or a different regimen of anti-D. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. Main results: Two trials with moderate to high risk of bias, involving over 4500 women, compared anti-D prophylaxis with no anti-D during pregnancy. When women received anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks' gestation, risks of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end were not significantly different than for women not given antenatal anti-D: risk ratio (RR) of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end during pregnancy was 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.17); after the birth of a Rh-positive infant the RR was 0.42 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.17); and within 12 months after birth of a Rh-positive infant the RR was 0.39 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.62). However, women receiving anti-D during pregnancy were significantly less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test (which detects fetal cells in maternal blood) in pregnancy (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88) and at the birth of a Rh-positive infant (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79). No data were available for the risk of Rhesus D alloimmunisation in a subsequent pregnancy. No significant differences were seen for neonatal jaundice, and no adverse effects were reported in either trial. Authors' conclusions: The risk of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during or immediately after a first pregnancy is about 1%. Administration of 100 \u03bcg (500 IU) anti-D to women in their first pregnancy can reduce this risk to about 0.2% without, to date, any adverse effects. Although unlikely to confer benefit in the current pregnancy, fewer women may have Rhesus D antibodies in any subsequent pregnancy, but the effects of this needs to be tested in studies of robust design."

                                "Background: Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality globally. Whilst pneumococcal polysaccharide @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (PPVs) have the potential to prevent disease and death, the degree of protection afforded against various clinical endpoints and within different populations is uncertain. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and effectiveness of PPVs in preventing pneumococcal disease or death in adults. We did not assess adverse events. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 6, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (January 1966 to June Week 2, 2012) and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to June 2012). Selection criteria: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults, provided the study outcome met the definition of the outcome considered in the review. We also considered non-RCTs in adults, where the study assessed PPV effectiveness against culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), provided the study controlled for important confounding factors. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors assessed trial quality of RCTs and three review authors extracted the data. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Two review authors assessed study quality and extracted data for non-RCTs. We calculated ORs and 95% CIs using a random-effects model following the conversion of each study outcome to a log OR and standard error (SE). Main results: Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria (18 RCTs involving 64,852 participants and seven non-RCTs involving 62,294 participants). @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of the RCTs found strong evidence of PPV efficacy against IPD with no statistical heterogeneity (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.45; random-effects model, I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic = 0%). There was efficacy against all-cause pneumonia in low-income (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.67, I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic = 19%) but not high-income countries in either the general population (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.12, I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic = 93%) or in adults with chronic illness (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.19, I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic = 10%). PPV was not associated with substantial reductions in all-cause mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09; random-effects model, I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic = 69%). @hit_startVaccine@hit_end efficacy against primary outcomes appeared poorer in adults with chronic illness. Non-RCTs provided evidence for protection against IPD in populations for whom the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is currently utilised (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61; random-effects model, I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic = 31%). This review did not consider adverse events as it was outside the scope of the review. Authors' conclusions: This @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end provides evidence supporting the recommendation for PPV to prevent IPD in adults. The evidence from RCTs is less clear with respect to adults with chronic illness. This might be because of lack of effect or lack of power in the studies. The @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end does not provide evidence to support the routine use of PPV to prevent all-cause pneumonia or mortality."

                                "Background: Antibodies to the red cell Rhesus D (RhD) antigen can be produced during pregnancy in a RhD-negative mother carrying a RhD-positive fetus, in particular following feto-maternal haemorrhage at birth or following any procedure that may cause feto-maternal haemorrhage. While the first baby is usually not harmed, these antibodies may cause haemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn (HDFN) in subsequent RhD-positive babies. RhD incompatibility is a major cause of HDFN. To reduce the risk of HDFN, anti-D is given to RhD-negative mothers at 28 or 30 weeks of pregnancy and within 72 hours of potential maternal exposure to fetal red cells. Anit-D is currently available in both intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) preparations. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and effectiveness of IM versus IV anti-D IgG in preventing RhD alloimmunization in RhD-negative pregnant women. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012). Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials and cluster-randomized trials comparing IM and IV anti-D for preventing RhD alloimmunization in RhD-negative pregnant women. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors extracted data. Data were checked for consistency by both authors. Main results: Two studies involving 447 (with sample sizes 14 and 432) RhD negative women were included. The studies compared IM and IV administration of anti-D prophylaxis. In both studies the women received a 1500 IU (300 microgram) dose of Rhophylac during week 28 of gestation. There was no incidence of RhD alloimmunization in either of the studies, as the sample size was insufficient for meaningful comparison of this uncommon outcome. One of the studies found that the mean anti-D IgG concentrations after IV and IM administration differed up to seven days (36.1 (2.6) ng/mL IV; 19.8 (8.7) ng/mL IM on day seven). However, from two to three weeks post-administration, the concentrations were similar for both routes of administration. None of the women involved in the studies developed antibodies against the RhD antigen. Authors' conclusions: It appears that IM and IV administration of anti-D are equally effective. The number of included studies and the number of participants are not enough to assess whether there are any differences. Anti-D can be administered by IM or IV injection. The choice of IM or IV route of administration will depend on the available preparations, the dose to be administered and also on the patients' preferences. This review found insufficient information upon which to guide practice due to the limited number of included studies, small sample sizes and methodological limitations."

                                "In the United States, annual @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged \u22656 months. Each season since 2004-05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to prevent influenza-associated, medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI). This season, early data from 1,155 children and adults with ARI enrolled during December 3, 2012-January 2, 2013 were used to estimate the overall effectiveness of seasonal influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI. After adjustment for study site, but not for other factors, the estimated @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness (VE) was 62% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 51%-71%). This interim estimate indicates moderate effectiveness, and is similar to a summary VE estimate from a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of randomized controlled clinical trial data; final estimates likely will differ slightly. As of January 11, 2013, 24 states and New York City were reporting high levels of influenza-like illness, 16 states were reporting moderate levels, five states were reporting low levels, and one state was reporting minimal levels. CDC and the Advisory Committee on @hit_startImmunization@hit_end Practices routinely recommend that annual influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end efforts continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Persons aged \u22656 months who have not yet been @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end this season should be @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end. However, these early VE estimates underscore that some @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end persons will become infected with influenza; therefore, antiviral medications should be used as recommended for treatment in patients, regardless of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status. In addition, these results highlight the importance of continued efforts to develop more effective @hit_startvaccines@hit_end."

                                "Background: Despite advances in chemotherapy, prognosis of ovarian cancer remains poor. Antigen-specific active immunotherapy aims to induce a tumour-antigen-specific anti-tumour immune responses as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. Objectives: To assess feasibility of antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer. Primary outcomes are clinical efficacy and antigen-specific immunogenicity with carrier-specific immunogenicity and side-effects as secondary outcomes. Search methods: A systematic search of the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2009, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialized Register, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end databases and clinicaltrials.gov was performed (1966 to July 2009). Hand searches were conducted of the proceedings of relevant annual meetings (1996 to July 2009). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non-randomised non-controlled studies that included patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of stage of disease, and treated with antigen-specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Data extraction was performed independently by two review authors. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Delphi-list for RCTs or a selection of quality domains pivotal to the assessment of non-RCTs and deemed best applicable to the non-randomised non-controlled studies. Main results: Thirty-six studies were included. Response definitions showed substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events was frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and non-RCTs frequently lacked information necessary to assess risk of bias. Serious biases in these trials can thus not be ruled out. The largest body of evidence is currently available for CA-125 targeted antibody therapy (15 studies: 1505 patients). Non-RCTs of this CA-125 targeted antibody therapy suggest increased survival in humoral and/or cellular responders. However, three large randomised placebo-controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of patients. Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens showed promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results, limited side effects and toxicity exploration of clinical efficacy in large well-designed RCTs may be worthwhile. Authors' conclusions: We conclude that despite promising immunological responses no clinically effective antigen-specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the adoption of guidelines to ensure uniformity in trial conduct, response definitions and trial reporting is recommended to improve quality and comparability of immunotherapy trials."
