                                "Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is one of the most important causes of healthcare-related infections among Gram-negative bacteria. The best therapeutic approach is controversial, especially for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains as well as in the setting of most severe patients, such as in the intensive care unit (ICU). Areas covered: This article addresses several points. First, the main microbiological aspects of PA, focusing on its wide array of resistance mechanisms. Second, risk factors and the worse outcome linked to MDR-PA infection. Third, the pharmacological peculiarity of ICU patients, that makes the choice of a proper antimicrobial therapy difficult. Eventually, the current therapeutic options against MDR-PA are reviewed, taking into account the main variables that drive antimicrobial optimization in critically ill patients. Literature search was carried out using @hit_startPubmed@hit_end and Web of Science. Expert commentary: Methodologically rigorous studies are urgently needed to clarify crucial aspects of the treatment against MDR-PA, namely monotherapy versus combination therapy in empiric and targeted settings. In the meanwhile, useful options are represented by newly approved drugs, such as ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam. In critically ill patients, at least as empirical approach, a combination therapy is a prudent choice when a MDR-PA strain is suspected."

                                "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common cancer worldwide. Besides tobacco use and alcohol consumption, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has also been identified as a risk factor for OSCC recently. The OSCC incidence has increased in recent years, especially among younger women. The purpose of this article is to review clinical and epidemiological studies on the association between HPV infection and OSCCs, and the efficacy of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, so as to provide possible policy implications for preventing HPV-positive OSCC. It is necessary to review the present related body of knowledge to determine whether the association between HPV infection and OSCC has been thoroughly studied. The study was based on @hit_startliterature review@hit_end. Studies were identified using electronic databases including @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, etc. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on consultation from a panel of experts in this area and carefully designed. Based on a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of literatures, HPV infection is a possible cause for the incidence of HPV-positive OSCCs. The prevalence of HPV infection possibly contributed to the increasing trends of HPV-positive OSCCs. Oral HPV infection is a form of HPV transmission. Oral sex behaviors and open-mouthed kissing are probably reasons for oral HPV infection. We also have some epidemiological evidences proving that HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end provides a possible solution for preventing oral HPV infection. Increased awareness of HPV-positive OSCCs is essential due to the severity of this problem. Biological and epidemiological data regarding the link between sexual behavior and HPV-associated cancers indicate a probable connection, although definitive data are needed. Future studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms of how HPV infection causes HPV-positive OSCCs, whether HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end provides a prevention for OSCCs, and other important issues."

                                "Background: Since the introduction of mobile phones, technology has been increasingly used to enable diabetes self-management education and support. This timely @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end summarizes how currently available technology impacts outcomes for people living with diabetes. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of high quality review articles and @hit_startmeta analyses@hit_end focused on utilizing technology in diabetes self-management education and support services was conducted. Articles were included if published between January 2013 and January 2017. Results: Twenty-five studies were included for @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. The majority evaluated the use of mobile phones and secure messaging. Most studies described healthy eating, being active and metabolic monitoring as the predominant self-care behaviors evaluated. Eighteen of 25 reviews reported significant reduction in A1c as an outcome measure. Four key elements emerged as essential for improved A1c: (1) communication, (2) patient-generated health data, (3) education, and (4) feedback. Conclusion: Technology-enabled diabetes self-management solutions significantly improve A1c. The most effective interventions incorporated all the components of a technology-enabled self-management feedback loop that connected people with diabetes and their health care team using 2-way communication, @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end patient-generated health data, tailored education, and individualized feedback. The evidence from this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end indicates that organizations, policy makers and payers should consider integrating these solutions in the design of diabetes self-management education and support services for population health and value-based care models. With the widespread adoption of mobile phones, digital health solutions that incorporate evidence-based, behaviorally designed interventions can improve the reach and access to diabetes self-management education and ongoing support."

                                "Objectives The aim of this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was to assess incidence rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) outcomes among infants under 6 months of age. Design Systematic @hit_startliterature@hit_end search and @hit_startreview@hit_end of indexed studies in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end Plus from inception to 19 April 2017. Setting Population-based estimates from community or hospital settings. Participants Infants under 6 months of age. Primary and secondary outcome measures LCI illness in ambulatory care settings, LCI hospitalisation, LCI intensive care unit admission and LCI death. Only studies with population-based incidence data were included. Results We identified 27 primary studies, 11 of which were from the USA, four were from other non-US high-income settings and the remaining were from lower-middle-income or upper-middle-income countries. Most studies (n=23) assessed incidence of LCI hospitalisation, but @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end to pool study-specific rates was not possible due to high statistical and methodological heterogeneity. Among US studies, the reported incidence of LCI hospitalisation ranged from 9.3 to 91.2 per 10 000 infants under 6 months for seasonal influenza, while the only US-based estimate for pandemic H1N1 influenza was 20.2 per 10 000 infants. Reported rates for LCI hospitalisation for seasonal influenza from other countries ranged from 6.2 to 73.0 per 10 000 infants under 6 months, with the exception of one study with an estimated rate of 250 per 10 000 infants. No events were reported in five of the nine studies that evaluated LCI death among infants under 6 months. Conclusion Our review of published studies found limited data on LCI outcomes for infants under 6 months, particularly from non-US settings. Globally representative and reliable incidence data are necessary to fully evaluate influenza disease burden and the potential impact of maternal influenza @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end programme on morbidity and mortality in young infants."

                                "Efficacyofinactivated Hantaan virusvaccine (Hantavax\u2122) has been questioned and controversial. This study was aimed to ensure @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness and the long-term immunogenicity of Hantavax@sup_beginTM@sup_endthrough high resolution metabolomics (HRM) using serum obtained from a phase III, multi-center, open-labelled clinical trial. A total of 19 subjects were administered with Hantavax\u2122 for 4 times with respective one month and 12 month intervals (0-1-2-13 schedule), including 2 primary and 2 booster doses. Based on antibody respace 5 people were high responders (HR), 8 were low responders (LR) and 6 were non responders (NR). Multivariate statistical @hit_startanalysis@hit_end through heat map and OPLS-DA using @hit_startMetaboAnalyst@hit_end 3.0 showed a clear separation among the NR, LR and HR. Arginine, phenylalanine and tyrosine were found with the same intensity among all 19 subjects regardless of antibody response, which confirms the long term efficacy of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. However, correlated to antibody response, cholesteryl nitrolinoleate, octanoyl-carnitine were significantly increased only among HR, while chenodeoxycholic acid, methyl palmitate were high among NR and LR but not HR. Our metabolomics study explainsthe molecular based reason for the controversies regarding the effectiveness of Hantavax@sup_beginTM@sup_end@hit_startvaccine@hit_end, and furthermore provides a critical insight in the reengineering of adjuvants for @hit_startvaccine@hit_end."

Considering the mandatory nature of @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end in many countries and the influences of parental experiences on the outcome of @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end, it is essential to understand the experiences and needs of parents regarding their children's @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end. @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, @hit_startPsycINFO@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus and ScienceDirect were searched for data. In this review, 20 studies (10 quantitative and 10 qualitative) that related to parental perceptions regarding their child's @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were included. The parents had varied views on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and they had many @hit_startvaccination@hit_end@hit_start-related@hit_end concerns and difficulties. Different factors influenced their @hit_startvaccination@hit_end decisions and they had varied support needs. This review found that exploring parental perceptions regarding their child's @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in terms of the attitudes and experiences of parents, how these affect @hit_startvaccination@hit_end decisions as well as the needs of parents regarding their children's @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end is important in multicultural societies."

                                "Background. One in three people in the U.S. will develop herpes zoster during their life. Zoster @hit_startVaccine@hit_end Live (ZVL or Zostavax\u2122), has been licensed in the U.S. since 2006 to prevent herpes zoster. ZVL protection has been shown to wane with time and estimates of effect can be imprecise. We performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the duration of efficacy and effectiveness of ZVL against herpes zoster (HZ). Methods. We systematically searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end, and clinicaltrials. gov for @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy or effectiveness (VE) studies of ZVL. Two authors independently screened each title and abstract, and potential VE studies were reviewed in-depth. Eligibility criteria included original data on ZVL prevention of HZ in a general population of immunocompetent recipients \u2264 60 years old. Selected articles were abstracted, independently reviewed, and discrepancies adjudicated. We attempted to locate relevant unpublished work and contacted authors for additional data, where necessary. Measures of association were illustrated on a forest plot and converted to VE (1-hazard ratio or risk ratio or odds ratio). Results. We screened 1302 articles; 17 underwent full text review and 8 met inclusion criteria and were abstracted for this review. Selected studies included 1 phase III randomized controlled trial, 2 quasi experimental and 5 observational studies. One experimental and 5 observational studies estimated VE during the period from @hit_startvaccination@hit_end up to 4 years following @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; estimates across studies ranged from 33%-55%. Two quasi experimental and 3 observational studies estimated VE for \u2265 4 years following @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; estimates ranged from 19%-40%; the median estimate was 24% (Figure). Pooled VE was not calculated due to heterogeneity in length of follow up, age distribution of study subjects, as well as adjustment for factors such as underlying medical conditions. Conclusion. Most experimental and observational studies estimate VE just above 50% during the 3 years following receipt of ZVL. Beyond 3 years, ZVL protection wanes, with most studies estimating a VE of \u226424% after 4 years. Information on overall efficacy and duration of protection from ZVL will guide policy decisions regarding its use."

                                "Background. Diarrhea is the seventh leading cause of death globally, responsible for more than 1,600,000 deaths in 2016 and nearly 90% of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) is an annual effort to produce and refine estimates of diarrheal disease burden attributable to Shigella spp., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and other enteric pathogens. Methods. We used a counter-factual approach to estimate deaths, incidence, years of life lost (YLLs), years living with disability (YLDs), and total disability adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to diarrhea and its etiologies, including Shigella and ETEC. To estimate the burden of diarrhea etiologies, we conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the proportion of diarrheal cases positive for each pathogen and modeled these data using a Bayesian @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression tool called DisMod-MR. This tool generates estimates of the pathogen distribution for national and some subnational geographies, all age groups, and for both sexes from 1990 to 2016. We used these estimates, in conjunction with odds ratios for diarrhea given pathogen detection from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study, to calculate the population attributable fraction for each pathogen. Results. In 2016, Shigella was responsible for 75,000 deaths among children under-5 and 270,000 deaths among all ages and ETEC was responsible for 22,000 deaths among children under-5 and 60,000 deaths among all ages. Shigella and ETEC ranked second and fourth with regard to pathogen contributions to global diarrheal deaths. Conclusion. The global burden of disease attributable to Shigella and ETEC is substantial. GBD 2016 estimates on the age- and location-specific impact of Shigella and ETEC enable evidence-based decision making regarding interventions to reduce the burden of these pathogens. Our findings call for accelerated efforts for the development of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against ETEC and Shigella."

                                "Background. Seasonal influenza epidemics are responsible for significant disease burden each year, especially in adults over the age of 65. Only recently have there been @hit_startvaccines@hit_end that are formulated specifically for individuals 65 years of age or older, one of which, Fluzone\u00aeHigh-Dose (IIV3-HD), has received widespread use in the US. This study aims to review the evidence of efficacy and effectiveness of IIV3-HD compared with standard dose influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (IIV3) in individuals aged 65 years or older against clinical outcomes plausibly related to influenza. Methods. A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of four electronic databases and other sources was conducted for randomized and observational studies assessing @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy or effectiveness (VE) of IIV3-HD against clinical outcomes such as influenza-like illness, hospital admissions and death in adults 65 years of age or older. A @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted by separately extracting individual VEs reported in the studies and estimating random-effects pooled efficacy against each of the clinical outcomes. Results. 7 eligible studies (4 randomized trials and 3 observational studies) were identified following the screening of 1,816 studies. All of these studies reported relative VE (rVE) of IIV3-HD vs. IIV3, and not absolute efficacy/effectiveness of IIV3-HD. Of those, 5 studies reported rVE for IIV3-HD vs. IIV3 against influenza-like illness, 6 studies reported rVE against hospital admissions, and 3 studies reported rVE against death. IIV3-HD demonstrated improved protection against influenza-like illness (rVE=18.3%, 95% CI: 7.0 to 28.3%), and was also more effective at preventing hospital admissions due to influenza illness (rVE=19.4%, 95% CI: 6.7 to 30.4%), pneumonia (rVE=22.4%, 95% CI: 5.0 to 36.5%), cardiorespiratory events (rVE=12.0%, 95% CI: 4.9 to 18.6%), and death following a hospital admission for influenza (rVE=22.2%, 95% CI: -18.2 to 48.8%). IIV3 also had a modest but not statistically significant impact on all-cause hospital admissions (rVE= 7.3%, 95% CI: -1.5 to 15.4%) and all-cause death (rVE=0.8%, 95% CI: -4.2 to 5.5%). Conclusion. There is significant evidence demonstrating IIV3-HD is more effective than standard dose influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end at reducing the clinical outcomes typically associated with influenza infection in older adults."

                                "Background. Well-recognized risk factors for herpes zoster (HZ), commonly known as shingles, are age and immunosuppression. Numerous studies have investigated other various risk factors for HZ in recent years. The objective of our study is to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end studies examining risk factors for HZ and discuss implications based on the updated evidence. Methods. We performed a literature search using @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, and Web of Science and included studies that examined risk factors for HZ. Random effects model was used to summarize the risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confdence interval (CI). Results. Of the 3450 studies screened, we included 84 studies in the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and conducted @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end in 62 studies. Women are at increased risk of HZ compared with men (pooled adjusted RR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.27, 1.34). Black individuals have almost half the risk of HZ than White individuals (pooled RR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.63). Family history was found to be a risk factor for HZ (pooled OR = 3.59; 95% CI: 2.39, 5.40). Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (pooled RR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.41, 1.98) and systemic lupus erythematous (RR = 2.10; 95% CI: 1.40, 3.15), were associated with an elevated risk of HZ. Other comorbidities were associated with an increased risk of HZ, with the pooled RRs ranging from 1.25 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.39) for asthma to 1.30 (1.17, 1.45) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.22,1.41) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Statin use was also associated with a modest increased risk of HZ (pooled RR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.17). Recent physical trauma increased risk of HZ by almost two-fold (pooled RR = 2.56; 95% CI: 1.97, 3.33). Conclusion. In addition to age and immunocompromised conditions, our review shows that female sex, race/ethnicity, family history, and comorbidities are risk factors for HZ. Efforts are needed to better understand risk factors and to increase the uptake of zoster @hit_startvaccination@hit_end."
