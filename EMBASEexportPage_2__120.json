                                "Objectives: Our objective was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end the current evidence on long-term effectiveness and cost effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in Europe with specific interest on risk-adapted strategies. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search to identify decision-@hit_startanalytic@hit_end modelling studies assessing the cost effectiveness of cervical cancer screening strategies in Europe using relevant databases (@hit_startMedline@hit_end/@hit_startEmbase@hit_end/@hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library/CRD/EconLit). Study characteristics and results were summarized in standardized evidence tables. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), life-years gained (LYG), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Economic results were converted to 2015 Euros using the GDP-PPP and CPI. Results: Fourteen studies mostly from countries with population-based organized screening were eligible for inclusion. HPV-based screening was reported to be more effective in terms of patient-relevant outcomes compared to cytology alone independent of HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status. Overall, HPV-based screening strategies were considered to be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 Euro/LYG conditional on screening intervals of at least three years in non-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end women and at least five years in @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end women. HPV screening was mostly accompanied with a triage test for HPV-positive women. Most studies recommended starting screening at age 25 using cytology with cross over to HPV-based screening at age 30 years or older and ending screening at 65 years. While studies considering generic cancer risk aspects to restrict screening algorithms, further more personalized screening, follow-up strategies according to a woman\u2019s screening, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end history and taking into account other risk factors have not been evaluated. Conclusions: Our research suggests that HPV-based screening is more effective compared to cytology alone, and can be considered cost effective at screening intervals of at least 3 (non-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end) to 5 years (@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end women). Current risk-tailored screening programs are based on generic restrictions to a specific age and using triage or follow-up tests for HPV-positive women before referring to colposcopy directed biopsy."

                                "Objectives: Influenza disease turns out to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality. New alternatives to conventional needle-and-syringe @hit_startvaccination@hit_end look out for expanding the access and dissemination of influenza @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. In this study, we described the current evidence regarding efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of a novel approach for influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods: Our Early-Awareness and Alert-System SINTESIS identified the use of a novel approach for influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end: \u201ctranscutaneous self-dissolving microneedle patches\u201d in July 2017. An early assessment of the technology was conducted through @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end on databases: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, Web of Science, Tripdatabase, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Search terms were as follows: microneedle patch [Title] AND influenza [Title]. Results: We found 23 studies (11 basic research, 2 opinion pieces, 2 phase I clinical trials, 2 ongoing clinical trials without results, 2 economic studies and 4 studies that did not assessed this new technology). We found only 2 independent phase I clinical trials that evaluated transcutaneous self-dissolving microneedle patches developed by different research groups versus conventional @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. No differences on treatment-related adverse events were found. In general, microneedle patches were well tolerated, although erythema was commonly reported after patch application. Antibody titers and seroconversion percentages were similar between intervention groups. Economic studies found the technology to be cost-effective, particularly in the event of an increased @hit_startvaccination@hit_end compliance. Conclusions: Current evidence showed no differences in the @hit_startimmunization@hit_end capacity of transcutaneous self-dissolving microneedle patches in relation to the needle-and-syringe @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Economic studies seem to consider the technology to be cost-effective, however, estimates have been based on theoretical models. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. Early assessment of new and emerging technologies allowed for collection of minimum necessary information to support decision-making regarding their inclusion in the health system."

                                "Objectives: In response to growing costs of innovative medicines, European countries are collaborating to improve patient access to high-cost medicines. The aim of this research was to identify and compare European cross-border drug procurement initiatives. Methods: A @hit_startliterature review@hit_end was conducted complemented by ad hoc communication with experts to fill in gap of unpublished information. Publicly available resources were used such as the European Commission website, World Health organisation website, national health authorities\u2019 websites, @hit_startMedline@hit_end\u00ae database, and grey literature. Results: Thirty European countries are voluntary cooperating in pharma procurement organised within ten regional initiatives established between 2012 and 2017: Western Europe (BeNeLuxA-I), Central-Eastern Europe (Sofia Declaration, Visegrad+ Collaboration, Romanian and Bulgarian agreement), Northern Europe (Nordic Collaboration, Baltic Partnership Agreement), and Southern/Mediterranean initiatives (Valletta Declaration, Southern European+, Iberia Partnership, France-Portugal Declaration of Intent). They totally represent about 377 Million inhabitants. Valletta topped the list grouping ten countries with approximatively 159 Million inhabitants while Baltic partnership represents about 6 Million inhabitants. For most of the collaborations, main scopes of joint procurement encompass expensive and innovative medicines, while others, are focused on biosimilars and generics such as Iberia Partnership, or at joint purchasing of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end such as Baltic Partnership. Several aspects of drug procurement are covered including joint price negotiations, joint health technology assessment, price information sharing, and horizon scanning. Only BeNeLuxA-I initiative is confirmed to have conducted pilot assessment with pharma industry (lumacaftor/ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis). Pilots for price negotiations within Valletta Declaration may also be on-going for 2 medicines. Conclusions: Several cross-collaboration initiatives have emerged in Europe for about 6 years to ensure sustainable access of new innovative and expensive drugs. However, noteworthy results have not been yet released. Cross-country collaborations still need to overcome legal, regulatory, political, structural and financial hurdles to become truly effective."

                                "Objectives: In Europe, meningococcal serogroup B is the most common cause of invasive meningococcal disease. The disease incidence is the highest among infants, young children and adolescents, while adolescents are considered the key transmitters of meningococci in the population. The disease is rare, but deadly and can cause permanent sequelae. The two new @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (4CMenB and rLP2086) were licensed in 2013 and 2017, respectively. Although the cost-effectiveness of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end 4CMenB has been assessed, only Ireland, Italy and England introduced this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in the publicly funded national @hit_startimmunization@hit_end programme (NIP), while Austria and the Czech Republic recommended it but without funding. The aim of the review is to summarise lessons learned from the cost-effectiveness studies and according to that contribute to decision-making for introducing the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in the NIP in the remaining European countries. Methods: The databases of @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and NHS EED were searched systematically to identify contributions (up to April 15, 2018) on the cost-effectiveness of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with the new @hit_startvaccines@hit_end versus no @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Keywords like meningococcal, serogroup B, 4CMenB, rLP2086 and cost-effectiveness were used. The quality of these studies was assessed according to the CHEERS checklist, they were only in English, performed for European countries and included different age groups. The main characteristics of the included studies were extracted. Results: A total of nine cost-effectiveness studies were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end. According to these @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is likely not cost-effective due to low incidence of the disease. Conclusions: Infant @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is a relevant strategy to public health in the short run, while adolescent @hit_startvaccination@hit_end may be a more effective strategy in the long run, if herd effects are taken into account."

                                "Objectives: The changing serotype distribution of pneumococcal disease in the older population since the introduction of PCV13 in infants has led to a renewed interest in the value of PPV23 @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of revaccinating adults aged 65 years or above with PPV23 after 5 years, when compared to a single dose of PPV23. Methods: A population-based Markov model was developed based on five health states including no pneumococcal disease, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBPP), post-meningitis sequelae and death. Adults aged 65 years or above in the UK were followed up to 100 years of age or until death, if earlier. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end efficacy against IPD was based on a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end and a clinical trial. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end efficacy against NBPP was based on a population-based cohort study and a clinical trial. Cost and utility were discounted at a rate of 3.5% annually. The main outcome estimated was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as additional cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A threshold of \u00a320,000 was considered cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were conducted to test the robustness of the result. Results: In the base case @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, compared to single dose @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with PPV23, discounted incremental costs and incremental QALYs gained for revaccination with PPV23 were estimated at \u00a399 million and 6,364, respectively, corresponding to an ICER of \u00a315,506/QALY. Conclusions: Revaccinating adults aged 65+ years with PPV23 in the UK was estimated to be a cost-effective @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategy as compared to @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end with a single dose of PPV23."

                                "Objectives: To inform future economic evaluations of human papilloma virus (HPV) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end was conducted to identify recent evidence of health state utilities for HPV-related diseases. Methods: @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end CENTRAL and @hit_startPsycInfo@hit_end were systematically searched for utility studies on HPV related diseases and Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) published in the last 10 years in English that met the pre-set eligibility criteria. Only studies that reported original health state utility data were included. Results: Twenty-seven studies were identified and mean utility scores were summarised. Utilities were elicited using EQ-5D, visual @hit_startanalog@hit_end scale (VAS), standard gamble, time trade-off, SF-6D and HUI 3. According to EQ-5D, health state utilities ranged from 0.75 to 0.87 for genital warts in women, 0.81 to 0.89 for genital warts in men 0.77 to 0.85 for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1, 0.58 to 0.81 for CIN 2-3, 0.15 to 0.87 for cervical cancer, 0.72 to 0.74 for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) grade 2-3, 0.58 to 0.69 for HPV-related HNC and 0.62 to 0.84 for HPV-unrelated HNC. EQ-5D value sets from seven different countries were applied (Argentina, Canada, Chile, Japan, Thailand, the UK and USA). VAS utility scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 for genital warts in women, 0.69 to 0.79 for genital warts in men, 0.61 to 0.78 for CIN 1, 0.60 to 0.77 for CIN 2-3, 0.18 to 0.59 for cervical cancer, 0.62 to 0.66 for VIN 2-3, 0.75 for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and 0.48 to 0.85 for HPV-unrelated HNC. Conclusions: We identified a large number of recent studies that reported health state utilities for HPV-related diseases and HNC, which could be used in economic evaluations. However, variation was observed in the utility elicitation method used and value sets applied."

                                "Introduction: Cervical cancer is a public health problem in the Maghreb countries with high mortality and socio-economic impact. The objective of this subject is exposed the epidemiological profile, programs of prevention and the support of cervical cancer in Maghreb (Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria). Methods: To implement this work, we carried out research on morbidity and mortality; cancer plans for Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia); cervical cancer surveillance for each country; the prevention programs of cervical cancer including @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, screening, information campaigns, awareness and education; and research conducted in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. We interviewed databases (@hit_startPubmed@hit_end, Sciences Direct etc.), ministerial website, World Health Organization website, foundations website and centers of cancer research. Results: The cervical cancer (CC) is diagnosed at advanced stages. The majority of patients are in advanced stages (stage II, III and IV). Regarding the histological profile squamous cell carcinoma is predominant. HPV 16 and HPV 18 single or multiple infection are by far the most common types of HPV associated with CCU in the Maghreb countries concerning the microbiological profile. All three countries have set up a cancer plans to prevent and control this disease and these impacts. Among the strong points of health policy in cancerology, in all three countries, we raised the existence of a cancer registry for monitoring and evolution of disease. Regarding the prevention of CC, in the three Maghreb countries, there is no primary prevention program (HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and the struggle against risk factors), much deficiencies about secondary and tertiary prevention. Conclusion: To win the fight against the CC, the Maghreb countries are called to strengthen the health system globally, to consolidate the national policy and the national guidelines to fight against the CC and to allocate the financial and technical resources to support the implementation policy and guidelines to make services accessible and affordable for women and girls."

                                "Background: @hit_startVaccination@hit_end is the most cost-effective intervention for primary prevention. The Maghreb countries had joined the The Expanded Programme on @hit_startImmunization@hit_end (EPI). Tunisia had also introduced the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib). Objective: To describ, through a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, the specific documentation on the EPI in Tunisia. Method: Target publications were collected using @hit_startMedline@hit_end database and Google Scholar from published articles from January 01 1998 to December 12 2017. The synthesis of the data was done according to four axes: \u00abinput\u00bb, \u00abprocess\u00bb, \u00aboutput\u00bb and \u00aboutcome\u00bb. Results: 17 articles were @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end, with an average of 4 publications every 5 years. The author\u2019s specialty was community and preventive medicine in 56% of cases. Six articles focused on the \u00abinput\u00bb @hit_startvaccination@hit_end program, five related to the @hit_startimmunization@hit_end process and the other five articles examined output and outcomes. Conclusion: Tunisian publications concerning @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were rare, their efficiency and impact on the change of national @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategy was crucial. Research coordination between Maghreb countries is highly recommended to meet the growing information needs."

                                "Background: Invasive meningococcal disease remains a public health concern because of its rapid onset and significant risk of death and long-term disability. New meningococcal serogroup B and combination serogroup ACWY @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are being considered for publicly funded @hit_startimmunization@hit_end programs in many countries. Contemporary costing data associated with invasive meningococcal disease are required to inform cost-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate costs and resource utilization associated with acute infection and the long-term care of invasive meningococcal disease. Data Sources and Methods: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, health economic databases, and electronically available conference abstracts were searched. Studies reporting any costs associated with acute infection and long-term sequelae of invasive meningococcal disease in English were included. All costs were converted into purchasing power parity-adjusted estimates [international dollars (I$)] using the Campbell and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Economics Methods Group and the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre cost converter. Results: Fourteen studies met our eligibility criteria and were included. The mean costs of acute admission ranged from I$1629 to I$50,796, with an incremental cost of I$16,378. The mean length of hospital stay was reported to be 6\u201318 days in multiple studies. The average costs reported for readmissions ranged from I$7905 to I$15,908. Key variables such as the presence of sequelae were associated with higher hospitalization costs and longer inpatient stay. No studies estimated direct non-healthcare costs and productivity loss. Ten studies reported only unadjusted mean values without using appropriate statistical methods for adjustment. Conclusions: Invasive meningococcal disease can result in substantial costs to healthcare systems. However, costing data on long-term follow-up and indirect costs used to populate health economic models are lacking."

                                "Patient race/ethnicity affects health care utilization, provider trust, and treatment choice. It is uncertain how these influences affect pediatric care. We performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus, Web of Science, @hit_startPsycINFO@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end, and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end) for articles examining race/ethnicity and parental treatment decision-making, adhering to PRISMA methodology. A total of 9200 studies were identified, and 17 met inclusion criteria. Studies focused on treatment decisions concerning end-of-life care, human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, urological surgery, medication regimens, and dental care. Findings were not uniform between studies; however, pooled results showed (1) racial/ethnic minorities tended to prefer more aggressive end-of-life care; (2) familial tradition of neonatal circumcision influenced the decision to circumcise; and (3) non-Hispanic Whites were less likely to pursue human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end but more likely to complete the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end series if initiated. The paucity of studies precluded overarching findings regarding the influence of race/ethnicity on parental treatment decisions. Further investigation may improve family-centered communication, parent engagement, and shared decision-making."
