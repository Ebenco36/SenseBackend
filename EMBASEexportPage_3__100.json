                                "Public health benefits of childhood @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end risk being derailed by low @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage in low and middle-income countries. One reason for the low coverage is poor parental knowledge of the importance of completing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedules. We therefore assessed the effects on childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage, of educating parents and other persons assuming the parental role. We prospectively registered the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, published the protocol, and used standard @hit_startCochrane@hit_end methods to collect and synthesise the evidence. We found six eligible randomised trials with 4248 participants. Three trials assessed health-facility based education of mothers on the importance of completing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedules; immediately after birth and three months later (one study) or during the first @hit_startvaccination@hit_end visit (two studies). The other trials assessed community-based education, including information campaigns on the importance of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end using audiotaped presentations and leaflet distributions (one study); structured group discussions on benefits and costs of childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and local action plans for improving @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake (one study); and home-based information sessions using graphic cards showing benefits and costs of childhood @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end and location of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end centres (one study). Combining the data shows that these interventions lead to substantial improvements in childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage (relative increase 36%, 95% confidence interval 14% to 62%). There was no difference between the effects of community-based and facility-based education. Therefore, education in communities and health facilities on the importance of childhood @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end should be integrated into all @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programmes in low and middle-income countries; accompanied by robust monitoring of impacts and use of data for action."

                                "Introduction: Hepatitis A can cause widespread outbreaks. Until 2018, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in the United States for individuals >40 years consisted of immune globulin (IG) administered as soon as possible after exposure, ideally within 14 days whereas those aged \u226440 should receive hepatitis A (HepA) @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. However, state health departments reporting difficulty quickly accessing and administering IG, costs of higher IG doses and importance of long-term HAV protection prompted CDC to review immunogenicity data for use of HepA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for PEP in older adults. We @hit_startreviewed literature@hit_end on use of HepA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in adults >40 years and existing recommendations for HepA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for use as PEP in other countries. Methods: We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end from January 1, 1992-January 7, 2017 using the terms \u201chepatitis A @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start\u2217@hit_end\u201d and \u201cHAV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start\u2217@hit_end.\u201d Two reviewers read each abstract and articles were preserved if they included results (seroprotection, mean titers) within 28 days of HepA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end administration in adults >40 years. Additionally, we reviewed PEP recommendations from six other jurisdictions. Results: A total of 1,039 unique articles were identified, of which eight were retained and two added from references. Three studies included direct comparisons between individuals aged >40 years and those \u226440 years and one other study included three age groups over 40 years, finding lowest immunogenicity in the oldest adults. All found higher proportions seroprotected (definition varied by study) in younger age groups (ages varied by study) at 15 days post-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end but similar seroprotection at 30 days. Most other jurisdictions reviewed recommended @hit_startvaccine@hit_end alone or in conjunction with IG for PEP in older adults. Conclusions: Immunogenicity of HepA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end may be diminished in older adults, especially in the very oldest age groups. HepA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end should be administered as soon as possible within 14 days after exposure to achieve the best possible immune response."

                                "Introduction: @hit_startVaccination@hit_end in pregnancy is an effective method to protect against disease for the pregnant woman, foetus and new born infant. In England, it is recommended that pregnant women are @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end against pertussis and influenza. Improvement in the uptake of both pertussis and influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end among pregnant women is needed to prevent morbidity and mortality for both the pregnant women and unborn child. Aim: To identify effective strategies in increasing the uptake of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in pregnancy in high-income countries and to make recommendations for England. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of peer @hit_startreviewed literature@hit_end was conducted using a keyword search strategy applied across six databases (@hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startPsychInfo@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end and Web of Science). Articles were screened against an inclusion and exclusion criteria and papers included within the review were quality assessed. Results and conclusions: Twenty-two articles were included in the review. The majority of the papers included were conducted in the USA and looked at strategies to increase influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in pregnancy. There is limited high quality evidence for strategies in high-income countries to increase coverage of pertussis and influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in pregnancy. A number of strategies have been found to be effective; reminders about @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on antenatal healthcare records, midwives providing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, and education and information provision for healthcare staff and patients. Future interventions to increase @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in pregnancy should be evaluated to ensure efficacy and to contribute to the evidence base."

                                "Background: Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPV) types is causally linked with the development of cervical precancer and cancer. HPV types 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers worldwide. Objectives: To evaluate the harms and protection of prophylactic human papillomaviruses (HPV) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against cervical precancer and HPV16/18 infection in adolescent girls and women. Search methods: We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end (June 2017) for reports on effects from trials. We searched trial registries and company results' registers to identify unpublished data for mortality and serious adverse events. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing efficacy and safety in females offered HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with placebo (@hit_startvaccine@hit_end adjuvants or another control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end). Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used @hit_startCochrane@hit_end methodology and GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for protection against cervical precancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above [CIN2+], CIN grade 3 and above [CIN3+], and adenocarcinoma-in-situ [AIS]), and for harms. We distinguished between the effects of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end by participants' baseline HPV DNA status. The outcomes were precancer associated with @hit_startvaccine@hit_end HPV types and precancer irrespective of HPV type. Results are presented as risks in control and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end groups and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals in brackets. Main results: We included 26 trials (73,428 participants). Ten trials, with follow-up of 1.3 to 8 years, addressed protection against CIN/AIS. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end safety was evaluated over a period of 6 months to 7 years in 23 studies. Studies were not large enough or of sufficient duration to evaluate cervical cancer outcomes. All but one of the trials was funded by the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end manufacturers. We judged most included trials to be at low risk of bias. Studies involved monovalent (N = 1), bivalent (N = 18), and quadrivalent @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (N = 7). Most women were under 26 years of age. Three trials recruited women aged 25 and over. We summarize the effects of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in participants who had at least one @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end. Efficacy endpoints by initial HPV DNA status hrHPV negative HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce CIN2+, CIN3+, AIS associated with HPV16/18 compared with placebo in adolescent girls and women aged 15 to 26. There is high-certainty evidence that @hit_startvaccines@hit_end lower CIN2+ from 164 to 2/10,000 (RR 0.01 (0 to 0.05)) and CIN3+ from 70 to 0/10,000 (RR 0.01 (0.00 to 0.10). There is moderate-certainty evidence that @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce the risk of AIS from 9 to 0/10,000 (RR 0.10 (0.01 to 0.82). HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce the risk of any CIN2+ from 287 to 106/10,000 (RR 0.37 (0.25 to 0.55), high certainty) and probably reduce any AIS lesions from 10 to 0/10,000 (RR 0.1 (0.01 to 0.76), moderate certainty). The size of reduction in CIN3+ with @hit_startvaccines@hit_end differed between bivalent and quadrivalent @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (bivalent: RR 0.08 (0.03 to 0.23), high certainty; quadrivalent: RR 0.54 (0.36 to 0.82), moderate certainty). Data in older women were not available for this comparison. HPV16/18 negative In those aged 15 to 26 years, @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce CIN2+ associated with HPV16/18 from 113 to 6 /10,000 (RR 0.05 (0.03 to 0.10). In women 24 years or older the absolute and relative reduction in the risk of these lesions is smaller (from 45 to 14/10,000, (RR 0.30 (0.11 to 0.81), moderate certainty). HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce the risk of CIN3+ and AIS associated with HPV16/18 in younger women (RR 0.05 (0.02 to 0.14), high certainty and RR 0.09 (0.01 to 0.72), moderate certainty, respectively). No trials in older women have measured these outcomes. @hit_startVaccines@hit_end reduce any CIN2+ from 231 to 95/10,000, (RR 0.41 (0.32 to 0.52)) in younger women. No data are reported for more severe lesions. Regardless of HPV DNA status In younger women HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce the risk of CIN2+ associated with HPV16/18 from 341 to 157/10,000 (RR 0.46 (0.37 to 0.57), high certainty). Similar reductions in risk were observed for CIN3+ associated with HPV16/18 (high certainty). The number of women with AIS associated with HPV16/18 is reduced from 14 to 5/10,000 with HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (high certainty). HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce any CIN2+ from 559 to 391/10,000 (RR 0.70 (0.58 to 0.85, high certainty) and any AIS from 17 to 5/10,000 (RR 0.32 (0.15 to 0.67), high certainty). The reduction in any CIN3+ differed by @hit_startvaccine@hit_end type (bivalent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end: RR 0.55 (0.43 to 0.71) and quadrivalent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end: RR 0.81 (0.69 to 0.96)). In women @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end at 24 to 45 years of age, there is moderate-certainty evidence that the risks of CIN2+ associated with HPV16/18 and any CIN2+ are similar between @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end and unvaccinated women (RR 0.74 (0.52 to 1.05) and RR 1.04 (0.83 to 1.30) respectively). No data are reported in this age group for CIN3+ or AIS. Adverse effects The risk of serious adverse events is similar between control and HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in women of all ages (669 versus 656/10,000, RR 0.98 (0.92 to 1.05), high certainty). Mortality was 11/10,000 in control groups compared with 14/10,000 (9 to 22) with HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (RR 1.29 [0.85 to 1.98]; low certainty). The number of deaths was low overall but there is a higher number of deaths in older women. No pattern in the cause or timing of death has been established. Pregnancy outcomes Among those who became pregnant during the studies, we did not find an increased risk of miscarriage (1618 versus 1424/10,000, RR 0.88 (0.68 to 1.14), high certainty) or termination (931 versus 838/10,000 RR 0.90 (0.80 to 1.02), high certainty). The effects on congenital abnormalities and stillbirths are uncertain (RR 1.22 (0.88 to 1.69), moderate certainty and (RR 1.12 (0.68 to 1.83), moderate certainty, respectively). Authors' conclusions: There is high-certainty evidence that HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end protect against cervical precancer in adolescent girls and young women aged 15 to 26. The effect is higher for lesions associated with HPV16/18 than for lesions irrespective of HPV type. The effect is greater in those who are negative for hrHPV or HPV16/18 DNA at enrolment than those unselected for HPV DNA status. There is moderate-certainty evidence that HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce CIN2+ in older women who are HPV16/18 negative, but not when they are unselected by HPV DNA status. We did not find an increased risk of serious adverse effects. Although the number of deaths is low overall, there were more deaths among women older than 25 years who received the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. The deaths reported in the studies have been judged not to be related to the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end.

                                "Background: Early childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is an essential global public health practice that saves two to three million lives each year, but many children do not receive all the recommended @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. To achieve and maintain appropriate coverage rates, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programmes rely on people having sufficient awareness and acceptance of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Face-to-face information or educational interventions are widely used to help parents understand why @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are important; explain where, how and when to access services; and address hesitancy and concerns about @hit_startvaccine@hit_end safety or efficacy. Such interventions are interactive, and can be adapted to target particular populations or identified barriers. This is an update of a review originally published in 2013. Objectives: To assess the effects of face-to-face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status and parental knowledge, attitudes and intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end. Search methods: We searched the CENTRAL, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, five other databases, and two trial registries (July and August 2017). We screened reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. We had no language or date restrictions. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effects of face-to-face interventions delivered to parents or expectant parents to inform or educate them about early childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, compared with control or with another face-to-face intervention. The World Health Organization recommends that children receive all early childhood @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, with the exception of human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (HPV), which is delivered to adolescents. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used standard methodological procedures expected by @hit_startCochrane@hit_end. Two authors independently reviewed all search results, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Main results: In this update, we found four new studies, for a total of ten studies. We included seven RCTs and three cluster-RCTs involving a total of 4527 participants, although we were unable to pool the data from one cluster-RCT. Three of the ten studies were conducted in low- or middle- income countries. All included studies compared face-to-face interventions with control. Most studies evaluated the effectiveness of a single intervention session delivered to individual parents. The interventions were an even mix of short (ten minutes or less) and longer sessions (15 minutes to several hours). Overall, elements of the study designs put them at moderate to high risk of bias. All studies but one were at low risk of bias for sequence generation (i.e. used a random number sequence). For allocation concealment (i.e. the person randomising participants was unaware of the study group to which participant would be allocated), three were at high risk and one was judged at unclear risk of bias. Due to the educational nature of the intervention, blinding of participants and personnel was not possible in any studies. The risk of bias due to blinding of outcome assessors was judged as low for four studies. Most studies were at unclear risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Other potential sources of bias included failure to account for clustering in a cluster-RCT and significant unexplained baseline differences between groups. One cluster-RCT was at high risk for selective recruitment of participants. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for the outcomes of children's @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status, parents' attitudes or beliefs, intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end, adverse effects (e.g. anxiety), and @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end cost, and moderate for parents' knowledge or understanding. All studies had limitations in design. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence where we judged that studies had problems with randomisation or allocation concealment, or when outcomes were self-reported by participants who knew whether they'd received the intervention or not. We also downgraded the certainty for inconsistency (@hit_startvaccination@hit_end status), imprecision (intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end and adverse effects), and indirectness (attitudes or beliefs, and cost). Low-certainty evidence from seven studies (3004 participants) suggested that face-to-face interventions to inform or educate parents may improve @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.37). Moderate-certainty evidence from four studies (657 participants) found that face-to-face interventions probably slightly improved parent knowledge (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.19, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.38), and low-certainty evidence from two studies (179 participants) suggested they may slightly improve intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.85). Low-certainty evidence found the interventions may lead to little or no change in parent attitudes or beliefs about @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.27; three studies, 292 participants), or in parents' anxiety (mean difference (MD) -1.93, 95% CI -7.27 to 3.41; one study, 90 participants). Only one study (365 participants) measured the intervention cost of a case management strategy, reporting that the estimated additional cost per fully @hit_startimmunised@hit_end child for the intervention was approximately eight times higher than usual care (low-certainty evidence). No included studies reported outcomes associated with parents' experience of the intervention (e.g. satisfaction). Authors' conclusions: There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that face-to-face information or education may improve or slightly improve children's @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status, parents' knowledge, and parents' intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end. Face-to-face interventions may be more effective in populations where lack of awareness or understanding of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is identified as a barrier (e.g. where people are unaware of new or optional @hit_startvaccines@hit_end). The effect of the intervention in a population where concerns about @hit_startvaccines@hit_end or @hit_startvaccine@hit_end hesitancy is the primary barrier is less clear. Reliable and validated scales for measuring more complex outcomes, such as attitudes or beliefs, are necessary in order to improve comparisons of the effects across studies."

                                "Introduction: Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a symptomatic disorder characterized by pelvic pain and urinary frequency. Immunological responses are considered as one of the possible etiologies of IC/BPS. In this review, we focused on emerging targets, especially on those modulating immunological mechanisms for the treatments of IC/BPS. Area covered: This review was based on the literature search of @hit_startPubMed@hit_end/@hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, for which key words following bladder pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and/or cyclosporine A (CyA) were used. We discussed current treatments and the drugs targeting the immune responses including CyA and other drugs with different mechanisms including NGF antibodies and P2X3 antagonists. Expert commentary: IC/BPS is often difficult to treat by current treatments. Immunosuppression agents, especially CyA are considered as effective treatments for IC/BPS with Hunner\u2019s lesion because these drugs suppress the inflammatory responses in the bladder underlying urinary symptoms of the disease. Base on the previous literatures, we should use CyA for the refractory IC/BPS, especially that with Hunner\u2019s lesion due to its side effects. New drugs targeting other mechanisms such as urothelial or afferent nerve dysfunction or new delivery systems such as sustained drug releasing devices or gene therapy techniques may be promising for the future treatments of IC/BPS."

                                "Background: Influenza is responsible for a significant disease burden annually, especially in older adults. This study reviews the relative @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy or effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (HD-IIV3) compared to standard-dose influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (SD-IIV3) in adults \u226565 against influenza-associated outcomes to inform evidence-based decision-making to shift clinical practice and standard of care in this population. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was conducted for studies assessing the rVE of HD-IIV3 against probable/laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions, and death in adults \u226565. Results from individual seasons were @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyzed@hit_end and a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled rVEs. Results: After screening 992 studies, seven studies were @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyzed@hit_end. HD-IIV3 demonstrated better protection against ILI compared to SD-IIV3 (rVE = 19.5%; 95% CI: 8.6\u201329.0%). HD-IIV3 was also more effective at preventing hospital admissions from all-causes (rVE = 9.1%; 95% CI: 2.4\u201315.3%), as well as from influenza (rVE = 17.8%; 95% CI: 8.1\u201326.5%), pneumonia (rVE = 24.3%, 95% CI: 13.9\u201333.4%), and cardiorespiratory events (rVE = 18.2%; 95% CI: 6.8\u201328.1%). rVE against post-influenza mortality was 22.2% (95% CI: -18.2\u201348.8%) and 2.5% (95% CI: -5.2\u20139.5%) against all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Available evidence suggests HD-IIV3 is more effective than SD-IIV3 at reducing the clinical outcomes associated with influenza infection in older adults and should be considered for routine use in the 65+ population."

                                "Introduction: In spite of the widespread implementation of preventive strategies, the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remains high. HAIs are associated with multidrug resistant organisms, and in the post-antibiotic era, alternative strategies such as @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are needed for their management. Areas covered: @hit_startVaccines@hit_end to prevent HAIs could be proposed to at-risk patients, or to healthcare workers (HCWs) to prevent cross-transmission. After searches in @hit_startPubmed@hit_end and clinicaltrials.gov, existing @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and @hit_startvaccines@hit_end under clinical development are presented in this narrative review. Issues associated with the use of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to prevent HAIs are discussed. Expert commentary: Future @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against HAIs will contribute to fight antibiotic resistance and thus reduce the burden of HAIs. At this stage, the goal of obtaining effective @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against S.aureus, C. difficile and gram-negative bacteria has not yet been achieved. Obtaining an efficient response to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in at-risk patients for HAIs is also challenging, and future strategies of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end need to address this difficulty. The efficacy of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for HCWs in reducing the spread of nosocomial outbreaks is counterbalanced by the lack of adherence to @hit_startvaccine@hit_end policies among HCWs. The acceptance of future @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to prevent carriage and infection with organisms involved in HAIs in HCWs will probably be a challenge."

                                "INTRODUCTION: The @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against Humanpapilloma Virus (HPV) is an effective strategy to prevent high-risk HPV infection and subsequent cervical carcinogenesis. Although the safety profile has been ascertained, the relation with the development of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disorders (AD) appears still controversial. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of chronic neurological impairment in young people, typically striking females. The main purpose of this review was to assess the association between HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and MS. METHODS: The @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end was carried out using 5 search engines: @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, SCOPUS, ISI WEB OF KNOWLEDGE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR and ClinicalTrial.gov. The web search was updated on January 2017. PRISMA checklist was adopted to address the content of the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end. The measures of outcome were reported as relative risk (RR) in cohort studies and odds ratio (OR) in case-control studies. RESULTS: The @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end identified 5 observational studies, 9 reviews, and 1 randomized clinical trials (RCT) pooled @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. The RR of MS onset detected by cohort studies ranged from 1.54 (95%CI, 0.04\u20138.59) to 1.37 (95%CI, 0.74\u20133.20). Concerning case-control studies, the OR spanned from 0.3, (95%CI 0.1\u20130.9) to 1.60 (95%CI = 0.79\u20133.25) for the group exposed to HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. No result was significant. CONCLUSION: This review showed no significant association between HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and MS. The low statistical power of the studies agreed with the low incidence of MS disease among general population. In order to overcome the shortcoming the research may be extended to the entire pattern of CNS ADs."

                                "Background: The success of human papillomavirus (HPV) national @hit_startimmunization@hit_end program depends on effective strategies in optimizing the uptake of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Given the increasing number of economic evaluations, this review was conducted to update the economic evidence on HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, by focusing on: (i) 9-valent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared to bi- or quadrivalent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end; (ii) gender-neutral @hit_startvaccination@hit_end compared to female only @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; and (iii) multiple age cohort @hit_startimmunization@hit_end compared to single age cohort @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. Methods: Searches were performed until June 2016 using 4 databases: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end; @hit_startEmbase@hit_end; @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library; and LILACS. The combined WHO, Drummond and CHEERS checklist were used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Results: Thirty-four studies were included in the review and most of them were conducted in high-income countries. The inclusion of adolescent boys in @hit_startvaccination@hit_end program was found to be cost-effective if @hit_startvaccine@hit_end price and coverage was low. When coverage for female was above 75%, gender-neutral @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was less cost-effective than when targeting only girls aged 9\u201318 years. Current evidence does not show conclusive proof of greater cost-effectiveness of 9-valent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared to the older HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end as the price for 9-valent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end was still uncertain. Multicohort @hit_startimmunization@hit_end strategy was cost-effective in the age range 9\u201314 years but the upper age limit at which @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was no longer cost-effective needs to be further investigated. Key influential parameters identified were duration of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end protection, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end price, coverage, and discounting rates. Conclusions: These findings are expected to support policy-makers in making recommendations for HPV @hit_startimmunization@hit_end programs on either switching to the 9-valent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end or inclusion of adolescent boys\u2019 @hit_startvaccination@hit_end or extending the age of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end."
