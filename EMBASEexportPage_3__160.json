                                "Purpose/Objective(s): Investigations in immunomodulating therapies for cancer treatment over the past 20 years have flourished. Given the complex tumor microenvironment and differential signaling pathways, a wide variety of potential targeting mechanisms have come to attention. Herein, we review the immunomodulating potential of Chemokine 21 (CCL-21) in preclinical and clinical studies, as well as examine the novel multifaceted immune-based treatments in advanced head and neck cancer. Materials/Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the CC-motif Chemokine Ligand 21 in order to identify the inflammatory historical background, role in cancer, preclinical investigations, and novel polymer-based delivery system was undertaken. Additionally, current ongoing clinical trials were evaluated for impact. Finally, the role of CCL-21 in the head and neck cancer population is reviewed and future pathways discussed. Results: The role of CCL-21 is critical in promoting DC homing and Tlymphocyte activation. Tumor antigen presentation is significantly amplified both locally and peripherally following introduction of CCL- 21. The results of the phase 1 studies in lung cancer and melanoma are promising. CCL21 is important in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures and their presence in tumors is associated with favorable immune responses. Conclusion: Based on the findings on CCL21, it is anticipated that the rational combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy will improve the antitumor benefit of this chemokine in a broad range of solid tumors with low tumor infiltrating lymphocyte frequency (TIL). Future studies could assess the combined efficacy of CCL21-based regimens with immune checkpoint blockade therapy in various solid tumors as immune activation by CCL21 leads to upregulation of PD-1 on activated T cells. CCL21-based therapeutic @hit_startvaccination@hit_end approaches will prove beneficial for tumors that are not accessible for intratumoral administration of CCL21. Furthermore, material and nanoparticle engineering provides several attractive strategies to design more potent CCL21 immunotherapy."

                                "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in pregnancy and account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK1. It is well known that antibiotic use is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance. Non-antibiotic measures to minimise antibiotic use for UTI prevention have been studied2 but the efficacy and safety of these measures in pregnancy have not been addressed. The aim of this study is to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end the @hit_startliterature@hit_end to identify non-antibiotic measures to prevent UTIs in healthy pregnant women. Databases (@hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus, Science Direct, @hit_startAMED@hit_end, CINHAL, BNI, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end trials and @hit_startPsycInfo@hit_end) were searched for randomised control trials (RCT) or observational studies reporting non-antibiotic measures to prevent UTIs in healthy pregnant women. Non-pregnant groups and co-morbidities such as diabetes and spinal cord injury were excluded. Search terms (\u201curinary tract infection\u201d or UTI or bacteriuria or cystitis) AND (prevention) AND (pregnant or pregnancy) were used to identify non-antibiotic measures to prevent UTIs in healthy pregnant women in accordance with the aim. A manual search of references from included studies was also conducted. Results were limited to English language. The quality of the publications was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool for quantitative studies. Search results yielded 3276 publications and after reviewing titles and removing duplicates, 57 full text articles were assessed for eligibility by FG and eight were included in the review. Of the included studies, three were observational with one rated as strong and two as moderate for quality. These studies provide evidence that behaviours such as wiping genitals from back to front are linked to more frequent UTIs in pregnancy which can be prevented by optimising genital hygiene. Two RCTs assessed cranberry juice and provide moderate evidence for its efficacy. Both studies however had a high withdrawal rate suggesting low acceptability and a need to investigate alternate formulations such as capsules or tablets. Two studies assessed the role of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end and were rated as weak because of inadequate study design. Therefore, although the studies viewed @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end as favourable, it remains an avenue which needs further exploration. The last study looked at ascorbic acid and the authors suggested it may be useful in areas with a high incidence of UTIs and antimicrobial resistance. This study did not use intention to treat @hit_startanalysis@hit_end which biases the result and so further studies need to be conducted to provide concrete evidence. A limitation of this review is that only English language publications were included and that there might have been options which have not been identified. Also, due to the heterogeneous design of the studies and the differing interventions; a narrative synthesis approach has been used to draw the results together. The results identified four different approaches (hygiene behaviour, cranberry juice, @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end and ascorbic acid) which are reported to be safe and effective in pregnancy. Future work needs to focus on strengthening the evidence base through improved design and reporting, in particular for @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end and ascorbic acid."

                                "Objectives: Brief positive affect interventions potentially offer a pragmatic approach to enhancing immune function for finite periods where this would be beneficial to health (e.g., in advance of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end or surgery). This review sought to systematically examine the evidence that brief, single-session interventions that improve mood also influence @hit_startimmunity@hit_end. Methods: Systematic searches of electronic databases were performed from earliest records to December 2016. We identified 34 interventions suitable for inclusion. Random effects @hit_startmetaanalyses@hit_end were performed for pre-post experimental group immune outcomes measured in at least 5 intervention studies. Results: While intervention forms were heterogeneous, 73.5% of interventions that improved mood resulted in a statistically significant change in at least one immune parameter. However, studies were, in general, of low-to-moderate quality with small sample sizes (median n=31) and did not examine the persistence, or clinical relevance of the immune changes observed. Random effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end showed a significant medium-sized effect of interventions on secretory IgA concentration (g=0.52), and non-significant effects on NK cell activity (g=0.15) and IL-6 production (g=0.11). Conclusions: We conclude that brief positive affect interventions can influence some immune parameters in ways indicative of enhanced immune function. However, there is a need for higher quality research in this area that focuses on clinically relevant immune outcomes and mechanisms."

                                "Objectives Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a predominant diarrheagenic E. coli pathovar responsible a substantial burden of acute diarrheal illness, deaths, and postdiarrheal sequelae including malnutrition, growth delays, and impaired cognitive development. Clinically, ETEC diarrheal illness ranges from mild to severe cholera-like disease. ETEC express heat-stabile toxin (ST) or heat-labile toxin (LT), or both. LT is an AB5 toxin closely related to cholera toxin. While epidemiological surveys have highlighted an association between individuals with blood group O and severe cholera, there is no apparent increase in ETEC disease severity linked to blood group O. Interestingly, our recent studies of ETEC pathogenesis led to the finding that a secreted adhesin specific to ETEC, EtpA, binds preferentially to blood group A (BgA) glycans. These interactions govern the effective delivery of both LT and ST to target epithelial receptors thereby contributing to disease severity. The study goal is to advance our understanding of the relationship between EtpA, disease severity, and blood type. Methods A variety of molecular methods were using to confirm an interaction between EtpA and BgA sugars. We screened against an array of more than 400 glycans, and confirmed the interactions with biolayer interferometry and hemagglutination. Next we generated a CRISPR-derived mutant of BgA expressing HT-29 carcinoma cells to produce only blood group O sugars which were again used to confirm the BgA-EtpA interaction. To advance our findings, were propagated intestinal stem cell derived enteroids as polarized monolayers from individuals with Blood Group A, B, or O. Finally, we obtained a convenience sample of 106 volunteers in controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies of ETEC diarrhea who served as @hit_startvaccine@hit_end placebo controls in prior studies. Blood type was determined in a blinded fashion and a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was performed to determine the association between blood type and diarrheal severity. Results Our glycan array containing more than 400 human glycans demonstrated that EtpA binds specifically to BgA sugars which were confirmed using biolayer interferometry whereby EtpA bound to BgA but not group B or O sugars. Only BgA red blood cells agglutinated in the presence of EtpA. Using the CRISPR-derived mutant of HT29 cells, EtpA binding was disrupted in the mutant line (blood group O) as was adhesion of the EtpA-expressing H10407 ETEC strain. Moreover these in vitro studies demonstrated that both EtpA and blood group A expression were essential for effective delivery of both toxins. We next confirmed these findings in polarized enteroid monolayers derived from human intestinal stem cells. Using enteroid lines from individuals with blood groups A, B, or O we demonstrated preferential binding of EtpA, as well as enhanced EtpA dependent bacterial adhesion and toxin delivery to blood group A cells. These findings prompted an examination of the relationship of blood group and disease severity using samples obtained from four prior ETEC CHIM studies in which 106 volunteers were challenged with the EtpA-expressing H10407 strain. A @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end demonstrated that blood group A or AB volunteers were more likely to develop moderate or severe diarrhea (MSD) relative to blood group O and B volunteers (odds ratio=1.44, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.90). Overall, 81% (95% CI: 66 to 97%, N= 24) of BgA patients developed MSD while for group O, 56% (44-69%, n=64) and B, 53% (25-82%, n=15) developed MSD. Age and race were not associated with MSD. Conclusions Collectively our results provide additional insight into the molecular pathogenesis of these common pathogens. EtpA appears to be the sole BgA binding lectin expressed by ETEC and is likely to be responsible for the increased disease severity in BgA volunteers. These findings have significant implications for design and interpretation of future ETEC CHIM studies and can inform the rational design of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to protect individuals at risk for the most severe cholera-like presentation of these infections."

                                "Traditional chemotherapeutic agents non-selectively eliminate cancer cells at the expense of normal tissue; in an attempt to minimize such effects, a new class of targeted agents, immunotherapy, was introduced in the late 1950s with the discovery of interferons and the development of the first cancer @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Ever since, immunotherapy evolved, exploiting different cellular mechanisms including dendritic cell therapy, monoclonal antibodies, and cytokines. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI) are the most recent subclass of this family and we herein review the basis of exploiting this new subclass of immunotherapy with radiotherapy in the context of studies evaluating their effects on human subjects and focusing on the synergism between the molecular pathways operating in the background. @hit_startPubMed@hit_end was searched for studies evaluating the combined use of ICPI and radiotherapy among human subjects. The majority of studies noted an increased response rate in patients receiving combined therapy with no significant increase in toxicity. Outcomes varied among the different ICPI, and treatment with combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 had a higher response rate compared to either modality alone. Synergistic use of ICPI and radiotherapy has the potential to improve survival, however the specifics regarding treatment plan is dependent on a myriad of factors including the genetic and molecular makeup of the tumor as well as the patient."

                                "Platelet refractoriness due to HLA alloimmunisation remains a signif-icant clinical problem despite universal leucodepletion of blood products, particularly if patients have a rare HLA type or multi-spe-cific HLA antibodies and/or when fully compatible platelets are not available. Provision of HLA-matched platelets by antigen matching remains a standard of care, although costly and time and labour intensive. @hit_startSystematic reviews@hit_end of different strategies for selecting HLA compatible platelets have indicated no high quality comparative data, and studies are rarely powered to show improved outcomes. This trial aimed to test whether HLA epitope-matched (HEM) platelet transfusions were non-inferior to standard HLA matched (HSM) platelet transfusions. A randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority, cross-over trial was conducted in alloimmunised thrombocytopenic patients with aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelodysplastic leukemia (AML) (ISRCTN23996532). The hypothesis was HEM platelets would result in better platelet increments, less bleeding, longer duration between platelet transfusions and increased availability of matched platelets without increasing donor panel size. Methods Participants aged \u226516 with HLA antibodies, platelet transfusion refractoriness and a requirement for multiple platelet transfusions according to local and British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines, were recruited from 14 English hospitals. Randomisation lists indicated 8 prophylactic study transfusions (HSM or HEM) in random order, plus up to 22 additional in case of any of the first 8 were not evaluable. HEM platelets were selected using HLAMatchmaker epitope matching programme predicting HLA compatibility by identifying epitopes on exposed areas of HLA molecules accessible to alloantibodies. The Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics laboratory staff and independent statistician were the only individuals un-blinded to treatment allocation. Primary out-come was 1 hour (10-90 min) post transfusion platelet count incre-ment (PCI). Several secondary outcome measures were evaluated including degree of HEM and HSM matching. A non-inferiority margin of 5 was chosen as the maximum difference in favour of HSM that would be clinically acceptable for the new HEM method to be implemented in practice. Hence HEM would be declared non-inferior if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was greater than a difference of 5 in favour of HSM. Results Between October 2012-November 2015, 49 patients (69% females) were randomised, with a diagnosis of AA (29%), MDS (18%) or AML (53%). Ages were 18-30 years (12%), 31-50 (27%), 51-70 (45%) and > 71 (16%). Among evaluable transfusions, patient characteristics were similar between HSM and HEM. For intention-to-treat, number of evaluable transfusions was 107 and 112 for HEM and HSM, respectively. For HEM transfusions, median number of epitope mismatches was 3 (0-15). Grade of HSM transfusions was A in 57 (52%), B1 in 36 (33%), B2 in 13 (12%), B3 in 3 (3%), B4 in 1 (1%). Matching of HSM transfusions was 0 HLA-A,B mismatches in 57, one antigen mismatch in 36, 2 mismatches in 13, 3 mismatches in 3 and 4 mismatches in 1. For primary outcome, mean (SD) PCI for HEM and HSM was 23.9(15) and 23.5(14.1) respectively, with adjusted mean difference of-0.1 (95% CI-2.9, 2.8). As the lower limit of 95% CI was >-5, HEM was declared non-inferior to HSM. There was no interaction between treatment and gender or diagnosis, and no difference in any secondary outcomes between HEM and HSM. Ongoing @hit_startanalyses@hit_end will correlate number of epitope mismatches with platelet refractoriness in highly sensitized patients and the natural history of HLA antibody production. Conclusion This study shows non-inferiority of HEM compared to HSM platelets. Benefits of HEM are increased availability of matched platelets for refractory patients, resulting in more efficient use of resources to maintain a smaller apheresis platelet donor pool.

                                "Introduction/Background: Ataxic Telangiectasia (AT) is a rare neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disease associated with immunodeficiency, poor coordination and disability. Ataxia Telangiectasia has a diverse clinical heterogeneity which may often lead to an incorrect diagnosis or late detection of the disorder resulting in exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation from various sources. Objectives: We present a female child from the Asian subcontinent that was seen for the first time with ulcerative skin lesions, failure to thrive and marked lymphopenia. Methods: A search of the @hit_startPubMed@hit_end database was carried out, using different combination of the terms \u201cAtaxia\u201d, \u201cTelangiectasia\u201d, typical , atypical and \u201cpresentation\u201d Results: Four-year-old Pakistani girl, product of first degree nuptial presented with generalized vesicular rashes mainly on abdomen and scalp which turned into ulcers with residual hypo pigmented lesions and diarrhea. She had short stature, failure to thrive (Weight and height < 5th percentile) and no previous infection or family history of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). Mild delay in milestones was observed especially in speech. Immunizations were up-to-date including BCG. On examination she had mild ocular telangiectasia but no cutaneous involvement. Investigations revealed lymphopenia (1.6) and eosinophilia. Workup for diarrhea including duodenoscopy revealing subtotal villous atrophy however the biomarkers for celiac disease were negative. Immune system workup showed high IgG levels, normal IgA, IgE and IgM level. IgG Subclasses: low IgG 2, and 3, antibody titers to H.Influenza and Pneumococcus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end were relatively low. Lymphocyte subsets showed low CD4,CD19 and high NK cells (40%), low na\u00efve T cells (2%) and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio.T cell function with post PHAwas 18.7% but had normal response to CD3. Alfa Feto Protein was requested due to continued low CD4 count and the level was found to be high: 260.9 IU/ml. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed homozygous mutation for Trp1750fs in chromosome 11 of ATM gene confirmed by whole exome sequencing. Immediate treatment with IVIG was started leading to mark improvement of skin lesions, diarrhea and weight gain. Conclusions: The index of suspicion of AT should be highlighted when deciphering Lymphocyte subset. Currently there is no neonatal screening for PID diseases and next generation sequences in Qatar. Once implemented it may prove beneficial in discovering cases from early infancy and reaching upon a definite diagnosis."

                                "Introduction Health care delivery is under pressure throughout the world and as such is experiencing many challenges related to demands to deliver affordable, accessible and appropriate health care to the world's population. Occupational health nurses (OHN) have an important role to play in the delivery of universal health coverage. It is important for OHNs to be flexible and dynamic enough to embrace the evolution of health care delivery and be part of it otherwise it runs the risk of becoming redundant. Methods A @hit_startreview@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end was conducted following a search of bibliographic databases including Cinhal Plus, @hit_startMedline@hit_end, Academic search complete, ERIC and MasterFILE Premier. Only English language literature published between 2007 and 2017 was searched, using search terms such as, but not limited to, future of nursing, role of occupational health nursing, future role of OHN, global health, sustainable development goals, universal health coverage and occupational health nursing education. Results The future of OHN is dependent on the health system of the country in which the OH services are being delivered but it should be embedded in a model of universal health coverage and part of the overall health delivery system. OHNs will need to ensure that it is part of the current and emerging trends in global health in order to remain relevant and effective. Conclusion OHNs will be the interface between the health system and working populations in improving health and quality of life. OHNs are important in delivering health services to a hard to reach population of adult workers who do not have time to attend to their health needs and particularly preventative health strategies such as @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end. OHNs will be pivotal in the early detection of emerging diseases related to globalisation and climate change, which need inter-professional collaboration and teamwork across multiple sectors for joint action."

                                "BACKGROUND: Globally, diabetes is one of the leading causes of death annually. Influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end has been shown effective in preventing complications in diabetic patients, however many patients with diabetes still remain unvaccinated. OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients of any age to understand the impact on patients health. METHODS: A @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end was performed using two electronic databases (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end) on the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in diabetic patients. RESULTS: Among 1,649 search results, 12 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for our review. All-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization rates were the measures of influenzavaccine effectiveness. All studies presented data on > 18 year old type 1 & type 2 diabetes patients. All diagnostic data was extracted using ICD-9 & ICD-10 codes. Studies were conducted in various countries U.S. (2), UK (2), Belgium (1), Netherlands (1), Spain (1), Canada (1), Israel (1), Taiwan (2). Some studies were of short duration (1-3 years) and few @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end longer data set (7-8 years). Studies conducted over a longer time period (> 2 yrs) captured variety of influenza strains in measuring @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness. Six studies reported an average range of 24% to 33% reduction in mortality rate and four studies reported a range from 28% to 54% reduction in hospitalization in @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end diabetic patients. Many studies exhibited bias (such as selection), missing age stratification and multiple @hit_startvaccination@hit_end confounding were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a steady increase in the level of evidence supporting the benefits of influenza @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end in diabetic patients. These benefits seem to outweigh the risk and hypothetical cost of not getting @hit_startimmunized@hit_end. Although influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is recommended, a lack of awareness, may still lead to less than desirable @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rates in diabetic patients. Our findings highlight the necessity for further research to assist in educating both patient and healthcare professionals on the benefits of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the diabetic community."

                                "BACKGROUND: Cancer-related infections lead to increases in mortality, antibiotic use, and hospital stays. Other adverse outcomes include dose delays and reductions, which can result in suboptimal treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Effective implementation of risk assessment and evidence-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of infection are essential to improve care and reduce costs related to infections in patients with cancer receiving immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) prevention of infection resource have been developed and updated to identify and disseminate the best available scientific evidence. FINDINGS: Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions were evaluated, resulting in recommended for practice rating for catheter care bundles, antimicrobial prophylaxis, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for specific populations, and implementation of contact precautions for resistant organisms."
