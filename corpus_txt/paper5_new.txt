"Outcome measures were prevention of reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) or viral culture confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 illness, hospitalization and mortality. We excluded studies which only evaluated non-specific outcomes such as influenza-like illness or all-cause mortality."
"Included in this review were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized studies, and meta-lyses that compared influenza vacction against control in patients with established cardiovascular disease and that reported clinically meaningful cardiovascular outcomes (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke)."

"Well-designed prospective studies are needed to provide stronger evidence of the protective effect of influenza vacction against stroke."
"This was done in two ways: (i) univariate linear regression, modelling each design feature explored on the absolute value of ΔVE, and (ii) logistic regression, where the outcome was a change in ΔVE of10 or more percentage points."
"The studies reported one of the following outcomes: incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza; incidence of ILI; incidence of absenteeism; the number of working days lost per person."
"Clinical outcomes Primary clinical outcomes were all-cause mortality (ACM) and major adverse clinical event (MACE). Secondary endpoints were MI, cardiovascular mortality (CVM), stroke, and HF"
"The primary outcome measure was laboratory-confirmed A (H1N1) influenza infection detected through serological method or RT-PCR. Moreover, the secondary outcomes include clinically defined ILI, acute respiratory illness, and absenteeism. "
"""The main effect outcomes are (1) the ratio of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza risk (any strain) during the period 6–12 months after receiving adjuvanted seasl influenza vaccines versus that of non-adjuvanted counterparts; and (2) the ratio of the seroprotection rate (the proportion with a ≥1:40 HI titer) 21–28 days after receiving the first dose of adjuvanted seasl influenza vaccines versus that of non-adjuvanted counterparts.

The main harm outcomes are the risk ratios of SAE and neurological events after receiving adjuvanted seasl influenza vaccines versus that of non-adjuvanted counterparts, up to the end of follow-up.

Secondary outcomes
We assessed other potentially important outcomes, including the ratio of the seroprotection rate 21–28 days after receiving the second dose of adjuvanted seasl influenza vaccines versus that of non-adjuvanted counterparts; and the risk ratios of (a) pain/tenderness at the injection site during the 7 days after the first dose; (b) pain/tenderness at the injection site during the 7 days after the second dose; (c) fever (body temperature higher than 38 °C) during the 7 days after the first dose; and (d) fever (body temperature higher than 38 °C) during the 7 days after the second dose."""
"The majority of studies used laboratory-supported influenza illness as a primary outcome and no strong conclusions could be drawn for severe outcomes such as hospitalisation, medically attended pneumonia, or mortality."
"The studies were assessed for their quality and data on the outcomes of influenza-like illness, laboratory-confirmed influenza, and hospitalizations were extracted."
"All the studies evaluated the SCR. The serological outcome was determined by HI assay at 21–28 days after vacction. The SPR was evaluated in most studies, excluding Dunkle et al. [34] (recombnt QIV in 18–49 age group) and Block et al. [22] (live attenuated QIV). Furthermore, in one RCT on live attenuated QIV, it was defined in a different way with respect to the other studies where the HI titer cut-off was set at 32 instead of 40" "Issued results on immunogenicity, in terms of seroconversion (SCR) or seroprotection rate (SPR), and efficacy, in terms of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
"For purposes of this review, influenza vaccine efficacy was defined as the relative reduction in influenza risk following vacction as determined by a RCT using medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza as the primary outcome of interest."
"The most commonly used definition of relative vaccine effectiveness was (1 – IRR) x100 (n = 27) where IRR denotes the incidence rate ratio for one group versus the other. " (infection)
"The primary outcome was influenza in non-vaccted contacts exposed to persons vaccted against influenza vs those not vaccted. Influenza included both laboratory-confirmed influenza (defined by one or more of the following: nucleic acid amplification testing, viral culture, antigen detection, pre-/post-season or acute/convalescent serology) or non-laboratory-defined evidence. Non-laboratory-defined evidence required the presence of influenza-like illness (ILI, as per the study definition) within a period of time when laboratory-confirmed influenza was circulating in the study area. Secondary outcomes included hospitalisation, pneumonia and death."
"All 4 RCTs reported significant vaccine efficacy of influenza vacction during prency against laboratory-confirmed influenza in the infants during the first 6 months of life" "For the outcome of hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza, the quality was judged as low based on data only being available from observatil studies."
"Translated to a wider scale, epidemiological studies have shown decreased rates of ICU admission for H1N1 influenza in countries including Sweden where vacction is more widely implemented" "In contrast, several studies of influenza vacction in patients ≥65 years have reported decreased incidence of severe illness (OR 0.57), lower 30-day mortality rates due to community acquired pneumonia (OR 0.72), and the highest proportion of influenza-related deaths prevented in this age group when compared to younger counterparts (88.9%)" "Yet, other estimates for vaccine efficacy (percentage reduction in disease) in this cohort have been more conservative"

"We defined influenza vaccine effectiveness as relative reduction in influenza risk in vaccted individuals in observatil studies that used medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza as the primary outcome of interest."
"the weighted-mean-difference (WMD) was calculated in the meta-lysis by using fix/random effects model to estimate whether the variables attenuate symptom severity on the vaccted group." Figure 2, Figure 3; "Compared with non-vaccted influenza patients, vaccted influenza patients were significantly less likely to have fever (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.43–0.89), be admitted to the intensive care unit (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64–0.97), or suffer mortality (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34–0.89), (Figure 2).

"Eligible studies reported one of the following outcomes: laboratory-confirmed influenza, influenza-like illness, or respiratory illness." " One study reported influenza vaccine efficacy against three different outcomes (including LCI, ILI, and RI). Two studies reported the vaccine efficacy against two different outcomes (including LCI and ILI). Of the sixteen studies that investigated only one outcome of interest, eight studies reported ILI, four reported LCI, and the remaining four reported RI."
"Eligible studies used observatil study designs (e.g., prospective cohort, test-negative case-control) and reported VE against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza for four mutually exclusive vacction groups: current season only, prior season only, both current and prior seasons, and neither season (reference group)."
"For inclusion, studies were required to focus on at least one countable outcome related to influenza infection: GP or emergency department visits, hospital admission or death." See Table 1: outpatient visit, hospitalization, deaths
"The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were: HF mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause hospitalisations, cardiovascular hospitalisation rates, HF-related hospitalisation rates, hospitalisation length and ventricular arrhythmias"
"For each age group and outcome [any influenza, A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B], we collected IVE estimates, their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) and the list of co-variates used in the multivariable lysis. "
"Taken together, these two reviews suggest that seasl influenza vacction had a moderate, though non-significant effect in protecting from influenza infection during the 2009 pandemic."

"We used the reported estimates when reported in the form of hazard ratios (HRs). If different estimates were available, we opted for HR, most adjusted effect measure, and propensity score-matched data." "Statistical lysis was performed by calculating adjusted HR using the random effect model, with a test for overall effect reported as Z-value, 95% confidence interval (CI), and probability value (P)."
"Pooled effects were reported as RRs or ORs for the RCTs or cohort studies, and for case-control studies, respectively, using Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) method with a random effect model."
"Forest plot showing the risk ratios of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza among children who received adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted trivalent vaccines or quadrivalent vaccines." "The weighted RT-PCR-confirmed influenza risk ratio, seroprotection RR (rate ratio) and adverse events risk ratio as well as the 95% CIs were estimated using Mantel–Haenszel method and summarized by Forest plots."
"Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 54·2% (95% CI 2·4 to 78·6) in 2010, 57·1% (15·5 to 78·2) in 2011, 38·4% (−71·7 to 78·1) in 2012, and 87·2% (67·2 to 95·0) in 2013."
"Vaccine effectiveness against influenza-like illness for live vaccines, using random effects model, was 31.4% (24.8%-39.6%) and using fixed-effect model 44.3% (42.6%-45.9%). Vaccine effectiveness against influenza-like illness for ctivated vaccines, using random effects model, was 32.5% (20.0%-52.9%) and using fixed-effect model 42.6% (38.3%-47.5%)."
"With respect to laboratory-confirmed influenza, for plant-derived QIVs, the attack rate in the vaccine group was 4.5% (215/4812), and in the placebo group it was 7.3% (251/4812), with an absolute vaccine efficacy of 38.8% (95%CI 17.9–48.7) to prevent influenza caused by any strain and of 35.1% (95% CI 17.9–48.7)"
"Using the relative risks reported in the study, VE was −20 % for ARI any time during prency (CI −59 to 9 %); and 39 % (CI −56 to 76 %) during the peak of the influenza season" " VE was reported as a secondary outcome in this study." "Black et al. [31] assessed VE in a retrospective cohort study of nearly 50,000 prent women across five influenza seasons (1997–2002)"
"Relative outcome estimated by study design. HR, hazard ratio; IRR, incidence rate ratio; IRRpool, pooled rate ratio; IVadj, instrumental variable adjusted; OR, odds ratio; ORpool, pooled odds ratio; OR&IRRpool, combined odds ratio and rate ratios pooled; PERR, prior event rate ratio; VE, vaccine effectiveness."
"We performed meta-lyses of RCTs and observatil studies separately. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as summary estimates using random-effects modelling (using RevMan 5.3 [21])."
"Using these 3 measures of influenza infection, the study reported a 41% reduction (risk ratio [RR] 0.59; 95%CI: 0.37 to 0.93) in the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza for infants born to vaccted women.""Wherever studies reported vaccine efficacy or effectiveness, Risk Ratios (RR) or Odds Ratios (OR) and the respective confidence intervals were calculated."
"Thetil Surveillance program for France, conducted over four influenza seasons (2009–2012), demonstrated that prior vacction conferred no protection against death, although it was protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio [OR] 0.5, 95% CI 0.5–0.97]), suggesting that vacction at the very least decreases disease severity."

"Vaccine efficacy (95% CI)" "In this study, the combined vaccine efficacy was 59% (95% CI 4–82)." "Studies were prospective (risk ratio) which are equivalent to case-control (odds ratio)."
See Figure 2 and 3; "The effects of categorical variables were weighted average pooled and expressed as odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) by using a DerSimonian-Laird method (Stockdale et al., 2017)." "Compared with non-vaccted influenza patients, vaccted influenza patients were significantly less likely to have fever (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.43–0.89), be admitted to the intensive care unit (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64–0.97), or suffer mortality (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34–0.89), (Figure 2)." "The weighted-mean-difference (WMD) was calculated in the meta-lysis by using fix/random effects model to estimate whether the variables attenuate symptom severity on the vaccted group. " "Compared with non-vaccted influenza patients, vaccted influenza patients had significantly short intensive care unit (ICU) stays (WMD = −1.37 days, 95% CI: −2.15 to −0.60) and hospital stays (WMD = −0.32 days, 95% CI: −0.61 to −0.04), (Figure 3)."
"After considering our predefined criteria for meta-lysis, we estimated the pooled arVE results for laboratory-confirmed IROs with influenza [28,34,54,55], (Figure 5a) and the pooled arVE regardless of the IRO determtion method [28,29,32,34,35,54], in this instance, stratified by season and age group (Figure 5b,c)." "The arVE was 3% (−2% to 7%) in the 2018–2019 influenza season." "Overall, it translated to a significant arVE of 11% (8% to 13%) in preventing IRO favoring the cell-cultured versus the egg-based vaccine in the 2017–2018 season."
Figure 2, Figure 3 --> RR "The pooled lysis of djusted data showed the statistically significant protection of seasl vaccine against LCI (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31–0.71; I2 = 48%) (Fig. 2; Table 2)." "Women with pdmH1N1 vacction had a lower risk of getting LCI (Relative risk [RR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26–0.35) and ILI (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06–0.36)). The pooled estimate from three randomized clinical trials (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31–0.71) and two case control studies (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23–0.61) showed that the seasl vaccine was protective against LCI. The seasl vaccine was not protective against ILI (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88–1.03). This association was similar for the outcome of RI (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.55–1.20)."
"Two reviewers (SB, LR) abstracted the data using a structured electronic data extraction form, extracting study characteristics (e.g., study design, recruitment setting, case definition) and VE estimates for the four vacction groups, with discrepancies adjudicated by consensus. Whenever possible, we extracted VE reports by influenza type/subtype and age group provided in the articles and only included the most specific results reported (e.g., by age group or influenza type/subtype) in the meta-lysis." "Table 2 Comparison of vaccine effectiveness (VE) by vacction group and influenza type/subtype"
"Considering outpatient or emergency department visits, VE demonstrated a clear significant overall effect of 39% (95%CI: 32–46%) of influenza vaccines among cases when compared with control children (). Since low heterogeneity was present between studies (I2 = 48.1%; p = 0.052), for this lysis a fixed-effect model instead of a random-effect model was used." "Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as VE = [(1-OR)x100] or VE = [(1-RR)x100] and crude ORs or RRs with relative 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) were estimated for each risk-group." "Additilly, among 10 studies considered about elderly a clear effect of 14% VE (95%CI: 7–21%; p<0.001) was observed in reducing hospital admission due to influenza with low heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 19.2%; p = 0.286)."
See Figure 2; "We conducted a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) meta-lysis using the inverse variance method and we chose HR with 95% CI to estimate the effect of the vaccine." --> Hazard Ratio
"We defined IVE as 100% × (1 –ratio of odds of vacction among influenza cases versus that among test-negative controls)." Figure 2, Table 3, Figure 3 --> VE
"With regard to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Breteler et al. [26] report on a study of schoolchildren in Ch [43], where a vaccine effectiveness of 87% (95% CI: 75%-93%) was found." "The review by Demicheli et al. [28] included a single pandemic study [44], which estimated a risk ratio of 0.11 (95% CI 0.06–0.21) associated with the 2009 ctivated pandemic vaccine in prent Japanese women." "Yin et al. [32] examined 11 case-control studies reporting on pandemic influenza vacction and laboratory-confirmed influenza, calculating a combined odds ratio of 0.14 (95% CI 0.07–0.27)"
"The relative risk (RR) was calculated for the number of influenza cases per treatment group for included RCTs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived based on a normal approximation." "VE was derived based on pooled RRs using the following formula: (1 - RR) × 100%." "The LAIV was protective against mismatched strains overall (11 RCTs, VE 60%, 95% CI 44% to 71%; Figure 3; Additil file 3)" Figure 3 - Figure 6: Relative risk -> RR, VE
"We included observatil studies fulfilling search criteria in which researchers estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) among fully vaccted (FV) and partially vaccted (PV) children, compared with unvaccted children." "A total of 8 of 10 studies used a test-negative design to estimate VE against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection."
"we present results as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and display results in forest plots." "Review Mger 5.3 determtion showed the overall OR to be 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55–0.75), for a VE of 36% (95% CI: 25–45%)" "Influenza VE was calculated as (1 − odds ratio) ×100%" -> RR, VE
"We reported effect sizes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs." "Overall, influenza vaccine was associated with reduction in cardiovascular mortality compared with control (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80–0.84 [P<0.001]) (I2=31%)"
"For the point estimate of VE and 95% confidence intervals (CI), we chose the Mantel–Haenszel method in a random effects model. Cross-protection of TIV and VE of A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines were both defined as 1-odds ratio (OR) in case–control studies and 1-risk ratio (RR) in cohort studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs)." "Our systematic review and meta-lyses demonstrate moderate cross-protection of seasl influenza vaccines of 34–38% against laboratory-confirmed 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 illness (based on eight case–control studies [7], [10], [17], [23], [24], [25], [26], [29] and one RCT [12]) and perhaps protection from hospitalisation too (one case–control study)" -> VE; Figure 2, Figure 3 -> OR "No significant effect was reported; RR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.84–2.26." -> RR
