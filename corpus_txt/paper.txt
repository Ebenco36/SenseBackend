Title: Global Prevalence of Hypertension: A Systematic Review

Methods:
We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from January 1990 to March 2024. 
After removing duplicates, 1,240 records were screened, and 137 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.
Seventy articles were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving 67 studies for analysis. 
Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts.

Results:
A total of 67 studies (n = 88,345 participants) from 25 countries were included. 
The largest sample sizes were from China (n = 35,812), the United States (n = 10,437), and Germany (n = 7,670). 
Other notable sample sizes included Bangladesh (n = 2,909), Ethiopia (n = 2,033), Egypt (n = 3,204), and Vietnam (n = 2,945).
Fourteen were randomized controlled trials, ten cohort studies, and three case-control studies.

Discussion:
The global prevalence of hypertension remains high, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
