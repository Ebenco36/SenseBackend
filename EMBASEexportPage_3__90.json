                                "Introduction: Seasonal influenza affects millions of people globally each year, causing significant morbidity and mortality. However, there remains substantial uncertainty about the attack rate (incidence) of influenza, particularly in unvaccinated individuals. Methods: We undertook a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza in the placebo arm. We calculated the influenza attack rate from included studies as the number of laboratory-confirmed positive seasonal influenza cases in the placebo arm divided by the total number of subjects in this arm. A random effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted to estimate the influenza attack rate among unvaccinated individuals (both symptomatic only as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic combined). Results: We included 32 RCTs that had a total of 13,329 participants. The pooled estimates for symptomatic influenza were 12.7% (95%CI 8.5%, 18.6%) for children (<18 years), 4.4% (95%CI 3.0%, 6.3%) for adults, and 7.2% (95%CI 4.3%, 12.0%) for older people (65 years and above). The pooled estimates for symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza combined for all influenza were 22.5% (95%CI 9.0%, 46.0%) for children and 10.7% (95%CI 4.5%, 23.2%) for adults. Only one study was identified for symptomatic and asymptomatic combined in older people which had a rate of 8.8% (95%CI 7.0%, 10.8%). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Conclusion: Overall, we found that approximately 1 in 5 unvaccinated children and 1 in 10 unvaccinated adults were estimated to be infected by seasonal influenza annually, with rates of symptomatic influenza roughly half of these estimates. Our findings help to establish the background risk of seasonal influenza infection in unvaccinated individuals."

                                "Background: Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever continue to be important causes of illness and death, particularly among children and adolescents in south-central and southeast Asia. Two typhoid @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are widely available, Ty21a (oral) and Vi polysaccharide (parenteral). Newer typhoid conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are at varying stages of development and use. The World Health Organization has recently recommended a Vi tetanus toxoid (Vi-TT) conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, Typbar-TCV, as the preferred @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for all ages. Objectives: To assess the effects of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for preventing typhoid fever. Search methods: In February 2018, we searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, LILACS, and mRCT. We also searched the reference lists of all included trials. Selection criteria: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing typhoid fever @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with other typhoid fever @hit_startvaccines@hit_end or with an inactive agent (placebo or @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for a different disease) in adults and children. Human challenge studies were not eligible. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria and extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We computed @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy per year of follow-up and cumulative three-year efficacy, stratifying for @hit_startvaccine@hit_end type and dose. The outcome addressed was typhoid fever, defined as isolation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in blood. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and efficacy (1 - RR as a percentage) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results: In total, 18 RCTs contributed to the quantitative @hit_startanalysis@hit_end in this review: 13 evaluated efficacy (Ty21a: 5 trials; Vi polysaccharide: 6 trials; Vi-rEPA: 1 trial; Vi-TT: 1 trial), and 9 reported on adverse events. All trials but one took place in typhoid-endemic countries. There was no information on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in adults aged over 55 years of age, pregnant women, or travellers. Only one trial included data on children under two years of age. Ty21a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (oral @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, three doses) A three-dose schedule of Ty21a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end probably prevents around half of typhoid cases during the first three years after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (cumulative efficacy 2.5 to 3 years: 50%, 95% CI 35% to 61%, 4 trials, 235,239 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). These data include patients aged 3 to 44 years. Compared with placebo, this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end probably does not cause more vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea or abdominal pain (2 trials, 2066 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), headache, or rash (1 trial, 1190 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); however, fever (2 trials, 2066 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) is probably more common following @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Vi polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (injection, one dose) A single dose of Vi polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end prevents around two-thirds of typhoid cases in the first year after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (year 1: 69%, 95% CI 63% to 74%; 3 trials, 99,979 participants; high-certainty evidence). In year 2, trial results were more variable, with the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end probably preventing between 45% and 69% of typhoid cases (year 2: 59%, 95% CI 45% to 69%; 4 trials, 194,969 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). These data included participants aged 2 to 55 years of age.The three-year cumulative efficacy of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end may be around 55% (95% CI 30% to 70%; 11,384 participants, 1 trial; low-certainty evidence). These data came from a single trial conducted in South Africa in the 1980s in participants aged 5 to 15 years. Compared with placebo, this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end probably did not increase the incidence of fever (3 trials, 132,261 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or erythema (3 trials, 132,261 participants; low-certainty evidence); however, swelling (3 trials, 1767 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and pain at the injection site (1 trial, 667 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) were more common in the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end group. Vi-rEPA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (two doses) Administration of two doses of the Vi-rEPA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end probably prevents between 50% and 96% of typhoid cases during the first two years after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (year 1: 94%, 95% CI 75% to 99%; year 2: 87%, 95% CI 56% to 96%, 1 trial, 12,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). These data came from a single trial with children two to five years of age conducted in Vietnam. Compared with placebo, both the first and the second dose of this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end increased the risk of fever (1 trial, 12,008 and 11,091 participants, low-certainty evidence) and the second dose increase the incidence of swelling at the injection site (one trial, 11,091 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Vi-TT @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (two doses) We are uncertain of the efficacy of administration of two doses of Vi-TT (PedaTyph) in typhoid cases in children during the first year after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (year 1: 94%, 95% CI -1% to 100%, 1 trial, 1625 participants; very low-certainty evidence). These data come from a single cluster-randomized trial in children aged six months to 12 years and conducted in India. For single dose Vi-TT (Typbar-TCV), we found no efficacy trials evaluating the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end with natural exposure. There were no reported serious adverse effects in RCTs of any of the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end studied. Authors' conclusions: The licensed Ty21a and Vi polysaccharide @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are efficacious in adults and children older than two years in endemic countries. The Vi-rEPA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is just as efficacious, although data is only available for children. The new Vi-TT @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PedaTyph) requires further evaluation to determine if it provides protection against typhoid fever. At the time of writing, there were only efficacy data from a human challenge setting in adults on the Vi-TT @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (Tybar), which clearly justify the ongoing field trials to evaluate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy."

                                "Background: The effectiveness of interventions to increase influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake in people aged 60 years and older varies by country and participant characteristics. This review updates versions published in 2010 and 2014. Objectives: To assess access, provider, system, and societal interventions to increase the uptake of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in people aged 60 years and older in the community. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, which includes the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, and ERIC for this update, as well as WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies to 7 December 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised trials of interventions to increase influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in people aged 60 years or older in the community. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used standard methodological procedures as specified by @hit_startCochrane@hit_end. Main results: We included three new RCTs for this update (total 61 RCTs; 1,055,337 participants). Trials involved people aged 60 years and older living in the community in high-income countries. Heterogeneity limited some @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end. We assessed studies as at low risk of bias for randomisation (38%), allocation concealment (11%), blinding (44%), and selective reporting (100%). Half (51%) had missing data. We assessed the evidence as low-quality. We identified three levels of intervention intensity: low (e.g. postcards), medium (e.g. personalised phone calls), and high (e.g. home visits, facilitators). Increasing community demand (12 strategies, 41 trials, 53 study arms, 767,460 participants) One successful intervention that could be @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysed@hit_end was client reminders or recalls by letter plus leaflet or postcard compared to reminder (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.15; 3 studies; 64,200 participants). Successful interventions tested by single studies were patient outreach by retired teachers (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.79 to 6.22); invitations by clinic receptionists (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.55 to 4.76); nurses or pharmacists educating and nurses @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end patients (OR 152.95, 95% CI 9.39 to 2490.67); medical students counselling patients (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.35); and multiple recall questionnaires (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.24). Some interventions could not be @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysed@hit_end due to significant heterogeneity: 17 studies tested simple reminders (11 with 95% CI entirely above unity); 16 tested personalised reminders (12 with 95% CI entirely above unity); two investigated customised compared to form letters (both 95% CI above unity); and four studies examined the impact of health risk appraisals (all had 95% CI above unity). One study of a lottery for free groceries was not effective. Enhancing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end access (6 strategies, 8 trials, 10 arms, 9353 participants) We @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysed@hit_end results from two studies of home visits (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.61) and two studies that tested free @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared to patient payment for @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.98 to 2.82). We were unable to conduct @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end of two studies of home visits by nurses plus a physician care plan (both with 95% CI above unity) and two studies of free @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared to no intervention (both with 95% CI above unity). One study of group visits (OR 27.2, 95% CI 1.60 to 463.3) was effective, and one study of home visits compared to safety interventions was not. Provider- or system-based interventions (11 strategies, 15 trials, 17 arms, 278,524 participants) One successful intervention that could be @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysed@hit_end focused on payments to physicians (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.77). Successful interventions tested by individual studies were: reminding physicians to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end all patients (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.99); posters in clinics presenting @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rates and encouraging competition between doctors (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.22); and chart reviews and benchmarking to the rates achieved by the top 10% of physicians (OR 3.43, 95% CI 2.37 to 4.97). We were unable to @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyse@hit_end four studies that looked at physician reminders (three studies with 95% CI above unity) and three studies of facilitator encouragement of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (two studies with 95% CI above unity). Interventions that were not effective were: comparing letters on discharge from hospital to letters to general practitioners; posters plus postcards versus posters alone; educational reminders, academic detailing, and peer comparisons compared to mailed educational materials; educational outreach plus feedback to teams versus written feedback; and an intervention to increase staff @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rates. Interventions at the societal level No studies reported on societal-level interventions. Study funding sources Studies were funded by government health organisations (n = 33), foundations (n = 9), organisations that provided healthcare services in the studies (n = 3), and a pharmaceutical company offering free @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (n = 1). Fifteen studies did not report study funding sources. Authors' conclusions: We identified interventions that demonstrated significant positive effects of low (postcards), medium (personalised phone calls), and high (home visits, facilitators) intensity that increase community demand for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, enhance access, and improve provider/system response. The overall GRADE assessment of the evidence was moderate quality. Conclusions are unchanged from the 2014 review."

                                "Crystalline/particulate substances trigger a plethora of signaling events in host cells. The most prominent consequence is the inflammatory reactions that underlie crystal arthropathies, such as gout and pseudogout. However, their impact on our health was underestimated. Recent work on the role of cholesterol crystal in the development of atherosclerosis and the harm of environmental particulates has set up new frontiers in our defense against their detrimental effects. On the other hand, in the last 100 years, crystalline/particulate substances have been used with increasing frequencies in our daily lives as a part of new industrial manufacturing and engineering. Importantly, they have become a tool in modern medicine, used as @hit_startvaccine@hit_end adjuvants and drug delivery vehicles. Their biological effects are also being dissected in great detail, particularly with regard to their inflammatory signaling pathways. Solid structure interaction with host cells is far from being uniform, with outcomes dependent on cell types and chemical/physical properties of the particles involved. In this review, we offer a systematic and broad outlook of this landscape and a sage @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of the complex nature of this topic."

                                "Background: Cost-effectiveness @hit_startanalysis@hit_end (CEA) is frequently used as an input for guiding priority setting in health. However, CEA seldom incorporates information about trade-offs between total health gains and equity impacts of interventions. This study investigates to what extent equity considerations have been taken into account in CEA in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using rotavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end as a case study. Methods: Specific equity-related indicators for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were first mapped to the Guidance on Priority Setting in Health Care (GPS-Health) checklist criteria. Economic evaluations of rotavirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in LMICs identified via a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end were assessed to explore the extent to which equity was considered in the research objectives and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, and whether it was reflected in the evaluation results. Results: The mapping process resulted in 18 unique indicators. Under the 'disease and intervention' criteria, severity of illness was incorporated in 75% of the articles, age distribution of the disease in 70%, and presence of comorbidities in 5%. For the 'social groups' criteria, relative coverage reflecting wealth-based coverage inequality was taken into account in 30% of the articles, geographic location in 27%, household income level in 8%, and sex at birth in 5%. For the criteria of 'protection against the financial and social effects of ill health', age weighting was incorporated in 43% of the articles, societal perspective in 58%, caregiver's loss of productivity in 45%, and financial risk protection in 5%. Overall, some articles incorporated the indicators in their model inputs (20%) while the majority (80%) presented results (costs, health outcomes, or incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) differentiated according to the indicators. Critically, less than a fifth (17%) of articles incorporating indicators did so due to an explicit study objective related to capturing equity considerations. Most indicators were increasingly incorporated over time, with a notable exception of age-weighting of DALYs. Conclusion: Integrating equity criteria in CEA can help policy-makers better understand the distributional impact of health interventions. This study illustrates how equity considerations are currently being incorporated within CEA of rotavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and highlights the components of equity that have been used in studies in LMICs. Areas for further improvement are identified."

                                "Background: Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) have multifaceted roles in the development of many tumor types. However, the prognostic value of TAMs in bladder cancer is still not conclusive. Experimental design: This review evaluated the prognostic value of TAMs density in bladder cancer by reviewing published literatures and integrating the results via a @hit_startmetaanalysis@hit_end. A systematic search was conducted in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies. Overall survival (OS), relapse free survival (RFS), disease specific survival (DSS), and progression free survival (PFS) were assessed in bladder cancer patients. Results: The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) indicated that TAMs identified with CD68 alone have no significant correlation with OS (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00-1.02), RFS (HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91-1.06), or PFS (HR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.70-1.68) in bladder cancer patients. Subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end involved with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) treatment or sample locations either showed that CD68+ TAMs presented no prognostic value with regard to OS in bladder cancer patients. However, TAMs detected by CD163 are significantly correlated with poor RFS in bladder cancer patients (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.16-1.92). Conclusions: Our data indicated that TAMs identified only with CD68 have no significant correlation with the prognosis and clinicopathological parameters of bladder cancer patients. However, TAMs detected with CD163 could serve as a prognostic marker for bladder cancer patients. These findings invite further research on the role of TAM subsets in bladder cancer patients."

                                "Background: Missed opportunities for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (MOVs) occur when persons eligible for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end visit a health facility and do not get the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end they need. We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end to assess effects of interventions for reducing MOVs. Methods: We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus, and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials in April 2017. Three authors independently screened search outputs, reviewed potentially eligible papers, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; resolving disagreements by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Results: Six studies (five trials and one cohort study) met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in the United States of America. All six studies had various limitations and were classified as having a high risk of bias. We found moderate certainty evidence that the following interventions probably improve @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage: patient education (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.38\u20132.68), patient tracking using community health workers (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.25), and patient tracking and provider prompts (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18\u20131.31). In addition, we found low certainty evidence that concurrent interventions targeting health-facility (education, prompts, and audit and feedback) and family settings (phone calls) may increase @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.46). Conclusions: The currently available evidence suggests that patient education, patient tracking, outreach sessions, and provider prompts reduce missed opportunities for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and improve @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage. Rigorous studies are required to confirm these findings and increase the certainty of the current evidence base. WHO is currently coordinating efforts to generate such evidence, especially from low-income and middle-income countries, and it is likely that the data will be available in the next few years."

We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end that compared the safety and immunogenicity of nonstandard influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategies with single-dose IIV in SOTRs. Booster doses and possibly high-dose (HD) influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategies seem to hold promise for improving @hit_startvaccination@hit_end immunogenicity in SOTRs. Administration of intradermal and MF59-adjuvanted trivalent IIV (IIV3) did not improve @hit_startvaccine@hit_end immunogenicity compared with single-dose intramuscular IIV. Alternative @hit_startvaccine@hit_end strategies were generally well tolerated; SOTRs who received HD, intradermal or adjuvanted IIV3 had a higher frequency of infection site reactions, while systemic adverse events were more frequent in SOTRs who received HD IIV3. Allograft rejection rates were similar in both groups. SOTRs should continue to receive standard-dose IIV annually in accordance with current recommendations, pending future studies to determine the optimal timing, frequency, and dosage of IIV using the booster-dose strategy."

                                "Brucella abortus strain 19 (S19), Brucella melitensis Rev 1 (Rev1), and B. abortus strain RB51 (RB51) are the three licensed animal brucellosis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, and they have been most commonly and successfully used in prevent brucellosis in animals. However, many adverse events (AEs) have been associated with these three @hit_startvaccines@hit_end after their administering to animals or being accidentally exposed to humans. In this study, 27 peer-reviewed publications containing animal and human AE reports associated with these three brucellosis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were manually annotated from the @hit_startPubMed@hit_end database. Our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end identified 20 animal AEs and 46 human AEs associated with the three @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Based on the Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) hierarchical classification, these animal AEs were enriched in the immune and reproductive systems that might eventually result in the occurrence of abortion or infertility. The human AEs were concentrated in the behavioral and neurological conditions, and these AEs showed flu-like symptoms that are consistent with human brucellosis. Furthermore, an @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of variance (ANOVA) statistics @hit_startanalysis@hit_end with linear model fits was used to determine the major variables that might affect the occurrence of abortion AE in animals. The ANOVA results indicated that three variables (P-value < 0.05) are significantly associated with the occurrence of abortion AE: animal species, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end dose, and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end route. The other two variables (i.e., @hit_startvaccine@hit_end type and animal age at @hit_startvaccination@hit_end) did not significantly (P-value > 0.05) associated with the occurrence of abortion AE. Overall, this study represents the first ontology-based @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of adverse events associated with animal @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. The results of such a study led to the better understanding of brucellosis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end AEs, facilitating rational design of more secure and effective @hit_startvaccines@hit_end."

                                "Despite the long-term efficacy and immune persistence observed following HBV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of infants, the need for a booster dose following infant @hit_startimmunization@hit_end continues to be deliberated. Evidence from HBV booster dose response studies and long-term @hit_startimmunization@hit_end program reviews are the basis for the recommendation that a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end booster is not necessary. However, further studies continue to emerge and highlight the need for standardization among observational studies in order to appropriately compare outcomes. There is an assumption that neonatal and infant (within 12 months of age) @hit_startvaccine@hit_end immune responses are equivalent; however, evidence exists for distinct @hit_startvaccine@hit_end responses within the first year of life. HBV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end programs have evolved over time, particularly regarding the type and dosage of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end used. Several universal neonatal @hit_startimmunization@hit_end programs initially incorporated a 2.5 \u03bcg dosage (Recombivax-HB, Merck). This dosage has been shown in multiple long-term studies and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end to be associated with a lower primary response, decreased antibody persistence over time, and a reduced booster response 10 to 20 years following @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. Ongoing surveillance of this and other HBV neonatally-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end populations, particularly in low endemic regions, is necessary to understand the impact on long-term protection in order to ensure lifelong protection against hepatitis B infection."
