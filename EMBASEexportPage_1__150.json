                                "Background: Herpes zoster (HZ) is one of the most common diseases among adults. Its reactivation is characterized by a severe and painful complication. In addition to the existing herpes zoster @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (ZVL), the FDA approved a new adjuvanted subunit zoster @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (RZV) in 2017 for use in adults aged 50 years and older. Several studies have assessed the cost-effectiveness of ZVL, many of which were conducted before the long-term @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy data was available in 2014. Objective: Our objectives were to (i) summarize and compare the cost-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end (CEAs) of ZVL conducted before and after 2014, (ii) summarize the CEAs of RZV, and (iii) critically assess the cost-effectiveness models and identify key parameters to consider for future CEAs of RZV. Methods: We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and two other databases from inception to March 2018 for original cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-benefit @hit_startanalyses@hit_end of HZ @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Three investigators independently reviewed and assessed full-text articles after screening the titles and abstracts to determine eligibility. For all included studies, we assessed study quality using the Drummond and Jefferson's checklist and extracted study characteristics, model structure, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end characteristics, incidence of HZ and complications, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. We summarized data by type of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, year of publication, and funding sources. Results: Twenty-seven studies met eligibility criteria. All studies were from high-income countries and were of moderate-to-high or high quality. Twenty studies repeatedly used four cost-effectiveness models. The assumption on long-term efficacy of ZVL was not based on clinical trial data in > 50% of studies. Fifteen out of 25 studies concluded that ZVL was cost-effective compared with no @hit_startvaccine@hit_end at a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end price ranging between US$93 and US$236 per dose (2018 US$), 40% of which were published after 2014. All industry-funded studies favored the use of ZVL. The single study assessing RZV found it to be more effective and less costly than ZVL, and cost-effective compared with no @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. More studies conducted after 2014 included various efficacy endpoints for ZVL, adverse reactions, and productivity loss compared with those conducted before 2014. Conclusions: A majority of studies of ZVL found it to be cost-effective compared with no @hit_startvaccine@hit_end using the authors\u2019 chosen willingness-to-pay thresholds. RZV was dominant in the single study comparing the two @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, but the finding needs to be confirmed with further studies in different settings. Future studies should assume @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy in line with clinical data, account for more efficacy endpoints for ZVL, and include other HZ long-term complications, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end adverse reactions, and productivity loss."

                                "Purpose: Esophageal cancer is a common disease in China with low survival rate due to no obvious early symptoms and lack of effective screening strategies. Traditional treatments usually do not produce desirable results in patients with advanced esophageal cancer, so immunotherapy which relies on tumor-related antigens is needed to combat low survival rates effectively. Cancer\u2013testis antigens (CTA), a large family of tumor-related antigens, have a strong in vivo immunogenicity and tumor-restricted expressing patterns in normal adult tissues. These two characteristics are ideal features of anticancer immunotherapy targets and, therefore, promoted the development of some studies of CTA-based therapy. To provide ideas for the role of the cancer\u2013testis antigens MAGE-A, NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, and TTK in esophageal cancer, we summarized their expression, prognostic value, and development in immunotherapy. Methods: The relevant literature from @hit_startPubMed@hit_end is reviewed in this study. Results: In esophageal cancer, although the relationship between expression of MAGE-A, NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, and TTK and prognosis value is still in a controversial situation, MAGE-A, NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, and TTK are highly expressed and can induce specific CTL cells to produce particular killing effect on tumor cells, and some clinical trials have demonstrated that immunotherapy for esophageal cancer patients is effective and safe, which provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of esophageal cancer in the future. Conclusion: In this review, we summarize expression and prognostic value of MAGE-A, NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, and TTK in esophageal cancer and point out recent advances in immunotherapy about them."

                                "Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can expose patients to a transient but marked immunosuppression, during which viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells is an attractive approach to restore protective T -cell @hit_startimmunity@hit_end in patients with refractory viral infections after allogeneic HSCT. Objectives: This narrative review summarizes clinical evidence and developments of almost 30 years of adoptive T -cell transfer. The review is based on evidence extracted from @hit_startPubMed@hit_end searches and the clinical and experimental work of the authors. Content: Viral infections after HSCT are frequently caused by the endogenous reactivation of persistent pathogens such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus (AdV). Current antiviral medication is not satisfactory and does not treat the underlying pathophysiology which is the lack of specific T -cell @hit_startimmunity@hit_end. Adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells could be a potentially curative, pathogen-specific, and non-toxic treatment providing long-term @hit_startimmunity@hit_end against the virus. The isolation of virus-specific T cells from a healthy donor and infusion into a recipient is known as adoptive T -cell transfer and has been performed in many patients using different treatment protocols. Based on basic research, new isolation protocols aim at a safe and fast availability of cellular products for adoptive T -cell transfer. We summarize preclinical and clinical data on each of the main pathogens and on the technical approaches currently available to target either single antigens or even multiple pathogens. Conclusion: Cellular therapy is considered as one of the major recent breakthroughs in medicine. Translation of this individualized treatment into first-line clinical routine is still limited. Main hurdles are availability of the technique, limited compatibility of classical phase III designs with cellular therapy, and regulatory restrictions. Multinational efforts are required to clarify the status of cellular treatment in first-line clinical routine with the overall objective to strengthen evidence-based treatment guidelines for the treatment of refractory viral infections post HSCT."

                                "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms become a foremost health concern in both developing and developed countries. These infectious agents show a wide spectrum of resistance against different antimicrobial drugs which causes a major public health threat all over the world. In recent years bacteria, fungi, virus, and parasites started to show prominent levels of multidrug-resistance with superior morbidity and mortality. MDR Salmonellosis requires costly drugs for effective treatment, and this is an added burden to the health-care segment in developing countries. @hit_startImmunization@hit_end in common areas with typhoid @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, rational use of antibiotic, improvement in public sanitation facilities, secure food handling and communal health instruction were considered to be as vital in the prevention of salmonellosis. These health and environmental issues require collective actions from governments, consumers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and health-care providers. Two methods were followed to congregate the information in this article. Firstly, we collected a list of relevant articles published through @hit_startPubMed@hit_end search, which includes original as well review articles. Secondly, book chapters on typhoid fever from standard textbooks on infectious diseases and social remedy were also reviewed."

                                "A high quality @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end search has three core attributes; it is systematic, comprehensive, and transparent. The current over-emphasis on the primacy of @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end over other forms of @hit_startliterature review@hit_end in health research, however, runs the risk of encouraging publication of reviews whose searches do not meet these three criteria under the guise of being @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end. This correspondence comes in response to Perman S, Turner S, Ramsay AIG, Baim-Lance A, Utley M, Fulop NJ. School-based @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programmes: a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the evidence on organization and delivery in high income countries. 2017; BMC Public Health 17:252, which we assert did not meet these three important quality criteria for @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end, thereby leading to potentially unreliable conclusions. Our aims herein are to emphasize the importance of maintaining a high degree of rigour in the conduct and publication of @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end that may be used by clinicians and policy-makers to guide or alter practice or policy, and to highlight and discuss key evidence omitted in the published review in order to contextualize the findings for readers. By consulting a research librarian, we identified limitations in the search terms, the number and type of databases, and the screening methods used by Perman et al. Using a revised Ovid @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end search strategy, we identified an additional 1016 records in that source alone, and highlighted relevant literature on the organization and delivery of school-based @hit_startimmunization@hit_end program that was omitted as a result. We argue that a number of the literature gaps noted by Perman et al. may well be addressed by existing literature found through a more systematic and comprehensive search and screening strategy. We commend both the journal and the authors, however, for their transparency in supplying information about the search strategy and providing open access to peer reviewer and editor's comments, which enabled us to understand the reasons for the limitations of that review."

                                "Context: Children in care of the child welfare system tend to underutilize preventive health services compared with other children. The purpose of this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was to assess current knowledge regarding @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage levels for children in the child welfare system and to determine barriers and supports to them utilizing @hit_startimmunization@hit_end services. Evidence acquisition: Articles published in @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, SocINDEX, and ERIC from January 1, 2000 to October 13, 2017 were searched. Thesis and conference databases and relevant websites were also examined. Studies were included if written in English, from high-income countries, and addressed immunizations for children in the child welfare system. Independent dual screening, extraction, and quality appraisal were conducted between October 2016 and December 2017, followed by narrative synthesis. Evidence synthesis: Of 2,906 records identified, 33 met inclusion criteria: 21 studied coverage, two studied barriers/supports, and ten studied both. Nineteen studies were moderate or high quality and thus included in the narrative synthesis; 15 studied coverage, one studied barriers/supports, and three studied both. Most studies found lower coverage among children in child welfare. The few studies that explicitly studied barriers/supports to @hit_startimmunization@hit_end identified that a collaborative and coordinated approach between health and social services was key to service delivery to this population. Conclusions: This review highlights that children in care of the child welfare system are at risk of poor @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage. There is a need for high-quality studies on this issue, with a focus on assessing supports/barriers to @hit_startimmunization@hit_end in this population."

                                "Upper respiratory symptoms are often treated with over the counter drugs, antibiotics, and antiviral medications. Due to concerns about safety and efficacy, there is a demand for an alternative solution. Black elderberry (Sambucus nigra) has been used to treat cold and flu symptoms, but there are no large-scale studies or @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end. This @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end quantifies the effects of elderberry supplementation and evaluates moderators including @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status and the underlying pathology. This @hit_startanalysis@hit_end included a total of 180 participants and evaluates moderators such as @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status and cause of the upper respiratory symptoms. Supplementation with elderberry was found to substantially reduce upper respiratory symptoms. The quantitative synthesis of the effects yielded a large mean effect size. These findings present an alternative to antibiotic misuse for upper respiratory symptoms due to viral infections, and a potentially safer alternative to prescription drugs for routine cases of the common cold and influenza."

                                "Purpose: Adolescents aged 10-19 represent a fifth of the world\u2019s population and have a high burden of morbidity, particularly in low-resource settings. Community-based peer facilitators could be a cost-effective way to increase access to interventions to improve adolescent health in such contexts, though evidence is limited to quasi-experimental and qualitative studies. To assess the potential of these interventions, we did a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of peer-facilitated community-based interventions for adolescent health in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: The review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016039190). We searched databases including @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, Web of Science and ERIC up until 22nd June 2018. We included randomised controlled trials of interventions facilitated by peers, defined as young people aged 10-24 recruited from the target population. We included studies with outcomes for key areas of adolescent health need: infectious and @hit_startvaccine@hit_end preventable diseases, undernutrition, HIV and AIDS, sexual and reproductive health, unintentional injuries, violence, physical disorders, mental disorders and substance abuse disorders. No date or language restrictions were applied. We narratively summarised intervention characteristics (e.g. non-peer facilitated complementary intervention activities, setting, type of facilitator and participant age) and described intervention effects in terms of these characteristics. Results: We included 20 studies with a total off 61,014 adolescents. Among four studies reporting outcomes related to HIV, none indicated a positive intervention effect. Peer facilitated interventions had no effect on clinical sexual and reproductive health outcomes, with the exception of one study, and two studies reported significant negative effects. Fifteen studies evaluated interventions linked to schools or a college. We found some evidence that these interventions were beneficial for improving mental health and reducing violence and substance use, though the diversity of outcomes assessed prevents us from making definitive statements about effectiveness. Twelve interventions had other non-peer facilitated components, including health worker and teacher training and dissemination of educational materials. We found benefits of interventions with and without these additional components. Conclusions: The evidence on the effects of peer-facilitated community-based interventions on adolescent health in low- and middle-income countries is mixed. Peer facilitation is a potential approach to improve adolescent mental health, especially in schools. Future research should investigate these interventions in more depth to understand why some interventions have beneficial effects and some do not, and to explore additional intervention activities that can complement peer-facilitated components.

                                "Purpose: Rotavirus (RV) & Norovirus (NoV) are the first and the second leading causes of severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide, respectively. To our knowledge, there are no @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end assessing the role of NoV in AGE in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the last update on the epidemiology of RV in the MENA region was performed in 2009. Consequently, we conducted an extensive @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end on articles studying RV and NoV in the 24 countries of the MENA region between 2000 and 2015. Methods & Materials: The methods and reporting were set according to the 2015 PRISMA-P and based on the elements from the international prospective register of @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end (PROSPERO). To ensure the comprehensiveness and completeness of the search, six electronic bibliographic databases were used. The Global Health Library (GHL) was used to retrieve studies published on the regional databases. Results: We retrieved 38 and 169 studies for NoV and RV, respectively, meeting our predefined inclusion criteria. Studies on NoV and RV were conducted in 15 and 19 out of the 24 countries of the region, respectively. The reported NoV infection rates ranged between 0.82% and 36.84% while RV rates ranged between 0.6% and 76%. The majority of studies were clinical observational studies assessing RV or NoV rates mainly among children. Participants were recruited from in- and outpatient clinics. These infections were reported all year round with peaks observed mainly during cold months. GII.4 was the predominant genotype detected in stool of participants studies (64%). The predominantly reported RV genotype in the region was G1[P8] followed by G2[P4] and G9[P8]. Conclusion: Overall, there is an increasing recognition of NoV as an important causative agent of AGE across all age groups in the MENA region. Further studies are needed to assess the national and the regional burden of NoV among different age groups, its molecular diversity and seasonal variability. Moreover, our review draws attention to the major gaps existing in the continuous monitoring and surveillance of RV and provides additional support to evaluate the implementation of using rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in the region."

Methods: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end databases were searched, combining the following search terms: \u2018herpes zoster\u2019 \u2018diabetes mellitus (DM)\u2019 \u2018chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\u2019 \u2018chronic heart failure\u2019 \u2018mental disorders\u2019 and \u2018immunocompromised\u2019. Supplements for local scientific congresses, non-indexed Spanish journals and official epidemiological reports, potentially HZ related, were also manually searched. The inclusion criteria were the following: English or Spanish publications reporting incidence of HZ in the Spanish general population and/or specific subpopulations. No restrictions were applied on the study design or population age. Results: Among 269 references retrieved (48 @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, 148 @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and 73 manual searching), 34 were finally included. Incidence of HZ in the general population ranged from 2.1 to 5.5/1000 person-years. HZ incidence ranged from 9.4 to 15.3/1000 patients with DM and from 11.0 to 11.4/1000 population with COPD or cardiovascular disease. In asthmatic patients, 6.9 HZ cases/1000 subjects were reported. The highest HZ incidence (1.3\u2013400.0/1000 person-years) was in immunocompromised persons (10.0/1000 patients with cancer, 12.5/1000 patients with AIDS, from 5.0 to 240.0/1000 transplanted patients and from 6.6 to 27.0/1000 population with rheumatic diseases). Three studies estimated an increased risk of HZ in comparison with general population, for patients with DM (24%), COPD (39%) and COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids (61%). Conclusions: The results suggest a high risk of HZ in certain age groups and specific subpopulations. This study could contribute to identify target age populations and at-risk groups if implementation of HZ @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programmes in Spain would be considered."
