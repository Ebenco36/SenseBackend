                                "Background: Viral respiratory tract infections in people with cystic fibrosis have a deteriorating effect on their lung function and disease progression. Annual influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is therefore commonly recommended for people with cystic fibrosis. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted the companies which market the influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end used in the trials to obtain further information about randomised controlled trials. Date of the most recent search of the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 08 July 2013. Selection criteria: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials (published or unpublished) comparing any influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end with a placebo or with another type of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Additional information was obtained by contacting the investigators when it was indicated. Main results: Four studies enrolling a total of 179 participants with cystic fibrosis (143 (80%) were children aged 1 to 16 years) were included in this review. There was no study comparing a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to a placebo or a whole virus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to a subunit or split virus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Two studies compared an intranasal applied live @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to an intramuscular inactivated @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and the other two studies compared a split virus to a subunit @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and a virosome to a subunit @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (all intramuscular). The incidence of all reported adverse events was high depending on the type of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. The total adverse event rate ranged from 48 out of 201 participants (24%) for the intranasal live @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to 13 out of 30 participants (43%) for the split virus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. With the limitation of a statistical low power there was no significant difference between the study @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end. None of the events were severe. All study influenza @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end generated a satisfactory serological antibody response. No study reported other clinically important benefits. Authors' conclusions: There is currently no evidence from randomised studies that influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end given to people with cystic fibrosis is of benefit to them. There remains a need for a well-constructed clinical study, that assesses the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on important clinical outcome measures."

                                "Background: Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease prevalent in tropical Africa and Latin America. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 200,000 cases of YF and 30,000 deaths worldwide annually. Treatment for YF is supportive, but a live attenuated virus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is effective for preventing infection. WHO recommends @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end for all individuals \u2265 9 months living in countries or areas at risk. However, the United States Advisory Committee on @hit_startImmunization@hit_end Practices (ACIP) advises that YF @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is contraindicated in individuals with HIV. Given the large populations of HIV-infected individuals living in tropical areas where YF is endemic, YF @hit_startvaccine@hit_end may be an important intervention for preventing YF in immunocompromised populations. Objectives: To assess the risk and benefits of YF @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end for people infected with HIV. Search methods: We used standard @hit_startCochrane@hit_end methods to search electronic databases and conference proceedings with relevant search terms without limits to language. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies of individuals with HIV infection who received YF @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (17DD or 17D-204). Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two authors screened abstracts of references identified by electronic or bibliographic searches according to inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the protocol. We identified 199 references and examined 19 in detail for study eligibility. Data were abstracted independently using a standardised abstraction form. Main results: Three cohort studies were included in the review. They examined 484 patients with HIV infection who received YF @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end. Patients with HIV infection developed significantly lower concentrations of neutralising antibodies in the first year post @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end compared to uninfected patients, though decay patterns were similar for recipients regardless of HIV infection. No study patient with HIV infection suffered serious adverse events as a result of YF @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Authors' conclusions: YF @hit_startvaccination@hit_end can produce protective levels of neutralising antibodies in HIV patients. Immunogenicity of YF @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is slightly less in HIV-infected patients compared to HIV-uninfected patients. No serious adverse events related to YF @hit_startvaccine@hit_end were observed in HIV-infected study participants. At time of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end, higher CD4 cell counts and lower HIV RNA levels in patients with HIV infection seem to be key determinants for development of protective titres of neutralising antibodies. The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low. YF @hit_startvaccine@hit_end may potentially be used safely in HIV-infected patients, although our conclusions are limited by small numbers of patients who have been reported. To assure maximum effectiveness YF @hit_startvaccine@hit_end should be given to HIV-infected patients after HIV replication has been suppressed."

                                "Introduction: Influenza infection is common among institutionalized older adults. Many nonrandomized observational studies on influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end suggested that it could reduce influenza-related hospitalizations and mortality in institutionalized older adults. Criticism regarding the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end estimated by nonrandomized observational studies include the frailty selection bias and use of nonspecific outcome, such as all-cause mortality. Methods: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of studies of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in institutionalized older adults to determine the effects on clinical outcomes. We searched for studies from 3 databases from 1946 to June 2013 assessing effectiveness against influenza infection. We selected studies with good comparability between @hit_startvaccine@hit_end group and control group. We expressed @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness (VE) as a proportion, using the formula VE = 1-relative risk or 1-odds ratio. We focused on the following outcomes: influenza-like illness (ILI), laboratory confirmed influenza, hospitalizations due to ILI, or pneumonia and death due to influenza or pneumonia. We did not include all-cause mortality. Results: Eleven studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria were identified, representing 11,262 institutionalized older adults. After @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, we found a significant reduction in pneumonia (VE: 37%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 18%-53%, P = 001) and death due to pneumonia or influenza (VE: 34%, CI: 10%-53%, P = 01). There was no significant heterogeneity between studies. There was no significant publication bias. Conclusion: Influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in institutionalized older adults could reduce pneumonia and death due to pneumonia or influenza. Influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is recommended for institutionalized older adults. \u00a9 2014 American Medical Directors Association, Inc."

                                "Background: Tetanus is a severe disease that can be prevented by @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. In developing countries @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage is not always high. Cases still occur also in developed countries, particularly in elderly people owing to their reduced immuno protection. There are about 1 million tetanus cases per year globally. In animal studies, vitamin C has protected against various infections and bacterial toxins. In a study with rats, vitamin C protected against the purified tetanus toxin. Objectives: To assess the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of vitamin C on tetanus. Search methods: In May 2013 we searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Wounds Group Specialised Register; The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library); Ovid @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end; Ovid @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); and Ovid @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end for this third update. Selection criteria: Controlled trials of vitamin C as a prevention or treatment for tetanus, whether or not these were placebo controlled, in any language, published or unpublished. Two review authors independently made inclusion decisions. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Both review authors independently extracted data from trial reports and assessed methodological quality. Since one of the cells in a 2 \u00d7 2 table had no events, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for case fatality rate by using the Peto-method. Another of the 2 \u00d7 2 tables had no empty cells and the inverse-variance method was used to calculate its risk ratio (RR) estimate and 95% CI. We also used the Fisher's exact test to calculate the exact 95% CI for the OR of the 2 \u00d7 2 table with the empty cell. Main results: One single trial was eligible for inclusion. This non-randomised, unblinded, controlled trial undertaken in Bangladesh involved 117 tetanus patients. Vitamin C at a dosage of 1 g/day was administered intravenously alongside conventional treatment. At recruitment, the participants were stratified into two age groups and the results were reported by age. There was a significant difference in the vitamin C effect between the two age groups (P = 0.01). In the tetanus patients aged 1 to 12 years (n = 62), vitamin C treatment was associated with a 100% reduction in case fatality rate (95% CI from -100% to -94%). In patients aged 13 to 30 years (n = 55), vitamin C treatment was associated with a 45% reduction in case fatality rate (95% CI from -69% to -5%). Authors' conclusions: A single, non-randomised, poorly reported trial of vitamin C as a treatment for tetanus suggests a considerable reduction in mortality. However, concerns about trial quality mean that this result must be interpreted with caution and vitamin C cannot be recommended as a treatment for tetanus on the basis of this evidence. New trials should be carried out to examine the effect of vitamin C on tetanus treatment."

                                "Background: This review is an updated version of the original @hit_startCochrane@hit_end review published in Issue 4, 2006. Needle-related procedures are a common source of pain and distress for children. Our previous review on this topic indicated that a number of psychological interventions were efficacious in managing pediatric needle pain, including distraction, hypnosis, and combined cognitive behavioural interventions. Considerable additional research in the area has been published since that time. Objectives: To provide an update to our 2006 review assessing the efficacy of psychological interventions for needle-related procedural pain and distress in children and adolescents. Search methods: Searches of the following databases were conducted for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs): @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end; @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end; @hit_startPsycINFO@hit_end; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (@hit_startCINAHL@hit_end); and Web of Science. Requests for relevant studies were also posted on various electronic list servers. We ran an updated search in March 2012, and again in March 2013. Selection criteria: Participants included children and adolescents aged two to 19 years undergoing needle-related procedures. Only RCTs with at least five participants in each study arm comparing a psychological intervention group with a control or comparison group were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality and a third author helped with data extraction and coding for one non-English study. Included studies were coded for quality using the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for all @hit_startanalyses@hit_end using Review Manager 5.2 software. Main results: Thirty-nine trials with 3394 participants were included. The most commonly studied needle procedures were venipuncture, intravenous (IV) line insertion, and @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. Studies included children aged two to 19 years, with the most evidence available for children under 12 years of age. Consistent with the original review, the most commonly studied psychological interventions for needle procedures were distraction, hypnosis, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The majority of included studies (19 of 39) examined distraction only. The additional studies from this review update continued to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis. No evidence was available to support the efficacy of preparation and information, combined CBT (at least two or more cognitive or behavioural strategies combined), parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality for reducing children's pain and distress. No conclusions could be drawn about interventions of memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, or distraction plus suggestion, as evidence was available from single studies only. In addition, the Risk of bias scores indicated several domains with high or unclear bias scores (for example, selection, detection, and performance bias) suggesting that the methodological rigour and reporting of RCTs of psychological interventions continue to have considerable room for improvement. Authors' conclusions: Overall, there is strong evidence supporting the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis for needle-related pain and distress in children and adolescents, with no evidence currently available for preparation and information or both, combined CBT, parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality. Additional research is needed to further assess interventions that have only been investigated in one RCT to date (that is, memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, and distraction plus suggestion). There are continuing issues with the quality of trials examining psychological interventions for needle-related pain and distress."

                                "Background: Measles is the leading killer among @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases; it is responsible for an estimated 44% of the 1.7 million @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end deaths among children annually. Objectives: To assess the effects of antibiotics given to children with measles to prevent complications and reduce pneumonia, other morbidities and mortality. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 4, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1966 to May week 4, 2013) and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1980 to May 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, to prevent complications in children with measles. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Main results: Seven trials with 1263 children were included. The methodological quality of most studies was poor. Only two studies were randomized, double-blind trials. There was variation in antibiotics used, their doses, schedule and evaluation of outcome. Pooled study data showed that the incidence of pneumonia was lower in the treatment group compared to the control group. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Of the 654 children who received antibiotics, 27 (4.1%) developed pneumonia; while out of 609 children in the control group, 59 (9.6%) developed pneumonia (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (0.12 to 1.01). The one trial that showed an increase in the rate of pneumonia with antibiotics was conducted in 1942 and compared oral sulfathiazole with symptomatic treatment. If the results of this trial are removed from the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, there is a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in children receiving antibiotics (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.60). The incidence of other complications was significantly lower in children receiving antibiotics: purulent otitis media (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.73) and tonsillitis (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.72). There was no difference in the incidence of conjunctivitis (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.15 to 1.0), diarrhea (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.22) or croup (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06). No major adverse effects attributable to antibiotics were reported. Authors' conclusions: The studies reviewed were of poor quality and used older antibiotics. This review suggests a beneficial effect of antibiotics in preventing complications such as pneumonia, purulent otitis media and tonsillitis in children with measles. On the basis of this review, it is not possible to recommend definitive guidelines on the type of antibiotic, duration or the day of initiation. There is a need for more evidence from high-quality RCTs to answer these questions."

                                "Background: Healthcare workers' influenza rates are unknown but may be similar to those of the general public. Healthcare workers may transmit influenza to patients. Objectives: To identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the effects of @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end healthcare workers on the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia, death from pneumonia and admission to hospital for respiratory illness in those aged 60 years or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs). Search methods: We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1966 to March week 3, 2013), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to March 2013), Biological Abstracts (1969 to March 2013), Science Citation Index-Expanded (1974 to March 2013) and Web of Science (2006 to March 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of healthcare workers caring for individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs and the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza and its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, or hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract infection) in individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Main results: We identified four cluster-RCTs (C-RCTs) (n = 7558) and one cohort study (n = 12,742) of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for HCWs caring for individuals \u2265 60 years in LTCFs. Three RCTs (5896 participants) provided outcome data that met our criteria. These three studies were comparable in study populations, intervention and outcome measures. The studies did not report adverse events. The principal sources of bias in the studies related to attrition and blinding. The pooled risk difference (RD) from the three cluster-RCTs for laboratory-proven influenza was 0 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.03) and for hospitalisation was RD 0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02). The estimated risk of death due to lower respiratory tract infection was also imprecise (RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02) in individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs. Adjusted @hit_startanalyses@hit_end which took into account the cluster design did not differ substantively from the pooled @hit_startanalysis@hit_end with unadjusted data. Authors' conclusions: The results for specific outcomes: laboratory-proven influenza or its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, or hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract illness) did not identify a benefit of healthcare worker @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on these key outcomes. This review did not find information on co-interventions with healthcare worker @hit_startvaccination@hit_end: hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, antivirals and asking healthcare workers with influenza or influenza-like-illness (ILI) not to work. This review does not provide reasonable evidence to support the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of healthcare workers to prevent influenza in those aged 60 years or older resident in LTCIs. High-quality RCTs are required to avoid the risks of bias in methodology and conduct identified by this review and to test further these interventions in combination."

                                "Background: Infection with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) bacteria is a common cause of diarrhoea in adults and children in developing countries and is a major cause of 'travellers' diarrhoea' in people visiting or returning from endemic regions. A killed whole cell @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (Dukoral\u00ae), primarily designed and licensed to prevent cholera, has been recommended by some groups to prevent travellers' diarrhoea in people visiting endemic regions. This @hit_startvaccine@hit_end contains a recombinant B subunit of the cholera toxin that is antigenically similar to the heat labile toxin of ETEC. This review aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and other @hit_startvaccines@hit_end designed specifically to protect people against diarrhoea caused by ETEC infection. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for preventing ETEC diarrhoea. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, LILACS, and http://clinicaltrials.gov up to December 2012. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing use of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to prevent ETEC with use of no intervention, a control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (either an inert @hit_startvaccine@hit_end or a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end normally given to prevent an unrelated infection), an alternative ETEC @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, or a different dose or schedule of the same ETEC @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in healthy adults and children living in endemic regions, intending to travel to endemic regions, or volunteering to receive an artificial challenge of ETEC bacteria. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two authors independently assessed each trial for eligibility and risk of bias. Two independent reviewers extracted data from the included studies and @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end the data using Review Manager (RevMan) software. We reported outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: Twenty-four RCTs, including 53,247 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Four studies assessed the protective efficacy of oral cholera @hit_startvaccines@hit_end when used to prevent diarrhoea due to ETEC and seven studies assessed the protective efficacy of ETEC-specific @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Of these 11 studies, seven studies presented efficacy data from field trials and four studies presented efficacy data from artificial challenge studies. An additional 13 trials contributed safety and immunological data only. Cholera @hit_startvaccines@hit_end The currently available, oral cholera killed whole cell @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (Dukoral\u00ae) was evaluated for protection of people against 'travellers' diarrhoea' in a single RCT in people arriving in Mexico from the USA. We did not identify any statistically significant effects on ETEC diarrhoea or all-cause diarrhoea (one trial, 502 participants, low quality evidence). Two earlier trials, one undertaken in an endemic population in Bangladesh and one undertaken in people travelling from Finland to Morocco, evaluated a precursor of this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end containing purified cholera toxin B subunit rather than the recombinant subunit in Dukoral\u00ae. Short term protective efficacy against ETEC diarrhoea was demonstrated, lasting for around three months (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71; two trials, 50,227 participants). This @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is no longer available. ETEC @hit_startvaccines@hit_end An ETEC-specific, killed whole cell @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, which also contains the recombinant cholera toxin B-subunit, was evaluated in people travelling from the USA to Mexico or Guatemala, and from Austria to Latin America, Africa, or Asia. We did not identify any statistically significant differences in ETEC-specific diarrhoea or all-cause diarrhoea (two trials, 799 participants), and the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end was associated with increased vomiting (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.45; nine trials, 1528 participants). The other ETEC-specific @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in development have not yet demonstrated clinically important benefits. Authors' conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence from RCTs to support the use of the oral cholera @hit_startvaccine@hit_end Dukoral\u00ae for protecting travellers against ETEC diarrhoea. Further research is needed to develop safe and effective @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to provide both short and long-term protection against ETEC diarrhoea."

                                "Background: Chronic pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis results in progressive lung damage. Once colonisation of the lungs with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs, it is almost impossible to eradicate. @hit_startVaccines@hit_end, aimed at reducing infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been developed. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms @hit_startvaccines@hit_end AND pseudomonas (last search 30 May 2013) and @hit_startPubMed@hit_end using the terms vaccin* AND cystic fibrosis (last search 30 May 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised trials (published or unpublished) comparing Pseudomonas aeruginosa @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (oral, parenteral or intranasal) with control @hit_startvaccines@hit_end or no intervention in cystic fibrosis. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: The authors independently selected trials, assessed them and extracted data. Main results: Six trials were identified. Two trials were excluded since they were not randomised and one old, small trial because it was not possible to assess whether is was randomised. The three included trials comprised 483, 476 and 37 patients, respectively. No data have been published from one of the large trials, but the company stated in a press release that the trial failed to confirm the results from an earlier study and that further clinical development was suspended. In the other large trial, relative risk for chronic infection was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.49), and in the small trial, the risk was also close to one. In the large trial, one patient was reported to have died in the observation period. In that trial, 227 adverse events (4 severe) were registered in the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end group and 91 (1 severe) in the control group. There was a marked rise in flagella antibody titres in the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end group and no change in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Authors' conclusions: @hit_startVaccines@hit_end against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cannot be recommended."

                                "Background: The common cold is a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract, characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, sore throat and fever (usually < 37.8C). The widespread morbidity it causes worldwide is related to its ubiquitousness rather than its severity. The development of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for the common cold has been difficult because of antigenic variability of the common cold virus and the indistinguishable multiple other viruses and even bacteria acting as infective agents. There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people. Objectives: To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for preventing the common cold in healthy people. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1948 to January week 1, 2013), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to January 2013), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (1981 to January 2013) and LILACS (1982 to January 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to prevent the common cold in healthy people. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. Main results: This review included one RCT with 2307 healthy participants; all of them were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end. This trial compared the effect of an adenovirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against a placebo. No statistically significant difference in common cold incidence was found: there were 13 events in 1139 participants in the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end group and 14 events in 1168 participants in the placebo group; risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 2.02, P = 0.90). No adverse events related to the live @hit_startvaccine@hit_end were reported. Authors' conclusions: This @hit_startCochrane@hit_end review has found a lack of evidence on the effects of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for the common cold in healthy people. Only one RCT was found and this did not show differences between comparison groups; it also had a high risk of bias. There are no conclusive data to support the use of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for preventing the common cold in healthy people. We identified the need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for the common cold in healthy people. Unless RCTs provide evidence of a treatment effect and the trade-off between potential benefits and harms is established, policy-makers, clinicians and academics should not recommend the use of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for preventing the common cold in healthy people. Any future trials on medical treatments for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for this condition. Outcome measures should include common cold incidence, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end safety and mortality related to the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end."
