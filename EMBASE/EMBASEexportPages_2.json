                            "Background: Global child mortality reduced substantially during the Millennium Development Goal period (2000\u201315). We aimed to estimate morbidity, mortality, and prevalence of risk factors for child pneumonia at the global, regional, and national level for developing countries for the Millennium Development Goal period. Methods: We estimated the incidence, number of hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality due to all-cause clinical pneumonia in children younger than 5 years in developing countries at 5-year intervals during the Millennium Development Goal period (2000\u201315) using data from a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and Poisson regression. We estimated the incidence and number of cases of clinical pneumonia, and the pneumonia burden attributable to HIV for 132 developing countries using a risk-factor-based model that used Demographic and Health Survey data on prevalence of the various risk factors for child pneumonia. We also estimated pneumonia mortality in young children using data from multicause models based on vital registration and verbal autopsy. Findings: Globally, the number of episodes of clinical pneumonia in young children decreased by 22% from 178 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 110\u2013289) in 2000 to 138 million (86\u2013226) in 2015. In 2015, India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, and China contributed to more than 54% of all global pneumonia cases, with 32% of the global burden from India alone. Between 2000 and 2015, the burden of clinical pneumonia attributable to HIV decreased by 45%. Between 2000 and 2015, global hospital admissions for child pneumonia increased by 2\u00b79 times with a more rapid increase observed in the WHO South-East Asia Region than the African Region. Pneumonia deaths in this age group decreased from 1\u00b77 million (95% UI 1\u00b77\u20132\u00b70) in 2000 to 0\u00b79 million (0\u00b78\u20131\u00b71) in 2015. In 2015, 49% of global pneumonia deaths occurred in India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia collectively. All key risk factors for child pneumonia (non-exclusive breastfeeding, crowding, malnutrition, indoor air pollution, incomplete @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end, and paediatric HIV), with the exception of low birthweight, decreased across all regions between 2000 and 2015. Interpretation: Globally, the incidence of child pneumonia decreased by 30% and mortality decreased by 51% during the Millennium Development Goal period. These reductions are consistent with the decrease in the prevalence of some of the key risk factors for pneumonia, increasing socioeconomic development and preventive interventions, improved access to care, and quality of care in hospitals. However, intersectoral action is required to improve socioeconomic conditions and increase coverage of interventions targeting risk factors for child pneumonia to accelerate decline in pneumonia mortality and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals for health by 2030.

                            "Rabies is one of the major public health problems in China, and the mortality rate of rabies remains the highest among all notifiable infectious diseases. A @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted to investigate the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rate and risk factors for human rabies in mainland China. The @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical and Wanfang databases were searched for articles on rabies @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status (published between 2007 and 2017). In total, 10 174 human rabies cases from 136 studies were included in this @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Approximately 97.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 95.1-98.7%) of rabies cases occurred in rural areas and 72.6% (95% CI 70.0-75.1%) occurred in farmers. Overall, the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rate in the reported human rabies cases was 15.4% (95% CI 13.7-17.4%). However, among @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end individuals, 85.5% (95% CI 79.8%-83.4%) did not complete the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end regimen. In a subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, the PEP @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rate in the eastern region (18.8%, 95% CI 15.9-22.1%) was higher than that in the western region (13.3%, 95% CI 11.1-15.8%) and this rate decreased after 2007. Approximately 68.9% (95% CI 63.6-73.8%) of rabies cases experienced category-III exposures, but their PEP @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rate was 27.0% (95% CI 14.4-44.9%) and only 6.1% (95% CI 4.4-8.4%) received rabies immunoglobulin. Together, these results suggested that the PEP @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rate among human rabies cases was low in mainland China. Therefore, standardised treatment and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programs of dog bites need to be further strengthened, particularly in rural areas."

                            "Metastatic melanoma is still associated with a poor prognosis, and there is increasing interest in immunotherapy alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies. \u0393\u03b4 T lymphocytes play a pivot role in the immune response against cancer, but while \u03b3\u03b4-based immunotherapy is already a clinical reality for several solid tumors, data on melanoma are still limited and fragmented. This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end presents preclinical and clinical evidence for a role of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes in immunotherapeutic strategies for advanced melanoma and discusses research state of the art and future perspectives. Current strategies focus on in vivo stimulation, and ex vivo adoptive therapy and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; results are promising, but further studies are needed to better investigate the interactions in tumoral microenvironment and to improve clinical efficacy of immunotherapeutic protocols."

                            "BACKGROUND: The @hit_startvaccine@hit_end system in England underwent radical changes in 2013 following the implementation of the Health and Social Care Act. There have since been multi-year decreases in coverage of many @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Healthcare professionals have reported finding the new system fragmented and challenging. This study aims to produce a logic model of the new system and evaluate the available evidence for interventions to improve coverage. METHODS: We undertook qualitative document @hit_startanalysis@hit_end to develop the logic model using process evaluation methods. We performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end by searching 12 databases with a broad search strategy to identify interventions studied in England conducted between 2006 and 2016 and evaluated their effectiveness. We then compared the evidence base to the logic model. RESULTS: We @hit_startanalysed@hit_end 83 documents and developed a logic model describing the core inputs, processes, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts of the new @hit_startvaccination@hit_end system alongside the programmatic assumptions for each stage. Of 9,615 unique articles, we screened 624 abstracts, 45 full-text articles, and included 16 studies: 8 randomised controlled trials and 8 quasi-experimental studies. Four studies suggest that modifications to the contracting and incentive systems can increase coverage, but changes to other programme inputs (e.g. human or capital resources) were not evaluated. Four multi-component intervention studies modified activities and outputs from within a GP practice to increase coverage, but were part of campaigns or projects. Thus, many potentially modifiable factors relating to routine programme implementation remain unexplored. Reminder/recall systems are under-studied in England; incentive payments to adolescents may be effective; and only two studies evaluated carer information. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base for interventions to increase @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end coverage in the new system in England are limited by a small number of studies and by significant risk of bias. Several areas important to primary care remain unexplored as targets for interventions, especially modification to organisational management."

                            "Context: The incidence of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is lower in women; however, women tend to present with more advanced disease. To date, there is no quantitative synthesis of studies reporting gender-specific outcomes in non\u2013muscle-invasive UCB. Objective: To conduct a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end evaluating gender-specific differences in recurrence of non\u2013muscle-invasive urinary bladder cancer (NMIBC). Evidence acquisition: An unrestricted systematic literature search of the @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end libraries was conducted. Studies evaluating the impact of gender on disease recurrence after local treatment of NMIBC using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were included. Random effect @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, @hit_startmeta@hit_end-influence, and cumulative @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end were conducted. Publication bias was assessed via a funnel plot and Egge\u0155s test. Evidence synthesis: Of 609 studies screened, 27 comprising 23 754 patients were included. Random effect @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end indicated women at increased risk for UCB recurrence compared with men (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01\u20131.23, p = 0.03). Subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end yielded estimates between HR = 0.99 and HR = 1.68. Gender-specific differences in UCB recurrence were most pronounced in studies administering exclusively bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG; HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13\u20132.39, p = 0.01), especially in a long-term treatment regimen (HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.32\u20132.15, p < 0.001). Sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end confirmed female patients at increased risk for UCB recurrence. Conclusions: Women are at increased risk for disease recurrence after local treatment of NMIBC compared with male patients. Reduced effectiveness of BCG treatment might underlie this observation. Gender-specific differences were evident across various subgroups and proved robust upon sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Patient summary: In this report, we combined several studies on gender-specific differences in relapse of superficial bladder cancer. Women were more likely to experience cancer relapse than men."

                            "Background Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is associated with high personal and economic burden. Recently, new treatment options for castration-resistant prostate cancer became available with promising survival advantages. However, cost-effectiveness of those new treatment options is sometimes ambiguous or given only under certain circumstances. The aim of this study was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end studies on the cost-effectiveness of treatments and costs of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastasizing castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) on their methodological quality and the risk of bias. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in the databases @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end Complete, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and Web of Science Core Collection for costs-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, model-based economic evaluations, cost-of-illness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end and budget impact @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Reported costs were inflated to 2015 US$ purchasing power parities. Quality assessment and risk of bias assessment was performed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist and the Bias in Economic Evaluations checklist, respectively. Results In total, 38 articles were identified by the systematic literature search. The methodological quality of the included studies varied widely, and there was considerable risk of bias. The cost-effectiveness treatments for CRPC and mCRPC was assessed with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominance for mitoxantrone to $562,328 per quality-adjusted life year gained for sipuleucel-T compared with prednisone alone. Annual costs for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer ranged from $3,067 to $77,725. Conclusion The cost-effectiveness of treatments of CRPC strongly depended on the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year gained/life-year saved throughout all included costs-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end and model-based economic evaluations. High-quality cost-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end based on randomized controlled trials are needed in order to make informed decisions on the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer and the resulting financial impact on the healthcare system."

                            "The global reduction in childhood infectious diseases since the 1960s is primarily due to the success of extensive worldwide @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end campaigns. However, the universal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage program appears to have lost momentum in the wake of negative, unfounded claims about the safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. While parents of the 21st century have little first-hand knowledge of devastating childhood diseases, grandparents are more likely to remember family and community members who were afflicted. In the current age of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end hesitancy and science scepticism, where research-informed arguments are not always persuasive, grandparents, through their experience of the diseases, may positively influence paediatric @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake. This paper @hit_startreviews@hit_end the @hit_startliterature@hit_end investigating potential direct or indirect influences of grandparents on parents\u2019 decisions to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end their children. A database search using the keywords @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, children and grandparents resulted in 1988 articles. Titles were screened for relevance and seventy-seven results were retained. After the abstracts were read, only five articles that either explored paediatric @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, factors promoting and/or inhibiting paediatric @hit_startvaccine@hit_end use and decision-making strategies were reviewed. One paper located through Google Scholar, which failed to show up on database searches, was also retained for a total of six papers. While none of the six papers set out to explore the impact of grandparents on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake, they found that grandparents were involved to varying degrees in paediatric @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake within young families. The research clearly showing that grandparents, and older people more generally, promote @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake is not currently available. The dearth of literature shows the need for research exploring the perceived and real influences of grandparents on childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. This will establish whether grandparents\u2019 memory and knowledge of preventable childhood infectious diseases could be harnessed as a public health measure to counteract the current, ill-informed, negative attention on paediatric @hit_startvaccines@hit_end."

                            "Introduction: Latin American countries were among the first to adopt rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end into national @hit_startimmunization@hit_end programs; we reviewed one decade of their experience with rotavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Areas covered: We @hit_startsystematically reviewed@hit_end manuscripts published January 1990\u2013January 2018 to assess rotavirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness (VE) via @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end; describe trends in rotavirus and acute gastroenteritis (AGE)-associated hospitalizations and mortality before and after @hit_startvaccine@hit_end introduction; and estimate annual hospitalizations and deaths averted by rotavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in Latin American and Caribbean children <5 years. Rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end demonstrated VE against rotavirus hospitalization of 76% (95% CI: 58\u201387) in low-mortality countries and 67% (95% CI: 54\u201376) in high-mortality countries for children <1 year of age. Reductions of 64.0% (interquartile range (IQR): 49.9\u201369.2) were observed in rotavirus hospitalizations, 32.8% (IQR 29.0\u201340.3) in AGE hospitalizations, and 53.5% (IQR: 40.4\u201357.1) in AGE-related mortalities in children <5 years. In 2015, an estimated 125,000 rotavirus-associated hospitalizations and 800 rotavirus-related deaths were prevented in countries that implemented rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Expert Commentary: Rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end remain an effective tool against diarrheal disease. The continued success of rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end provides evidence for adoption in Latin American and Caribbean countries that have not yet introduced it, and improvement within those with low coverage."

                            "Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to phenotypically similar disorders, including hemolytic uremic syndromes (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This review explores the role of the influenza virus as trigger of HUS or TTP. We conducted a literature survey in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Google Scholar using HUS, TTP, TMA, and influenza as keywords, and extracted and @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end reported epidemiological and clinical data. We identified 25 cases of influenza-associated TMA. Five additional cases were linked to influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end separately. Influenza A was found in 83%, 10 out of 25 during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Two patients had bona fide TTP with ADAMTS13 activity <10%. Median age was 15 years (range 0.5\u201368 years), two thirds were male. Oligoanuria was documented in 81% and neurological involvement in 40% of patients. Serum C3 was reduced in 5 out of 14 patients (36%); Coombs test was negative in 7 out of 7 and elevated fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products were documented in 6 out of 8 patients. Pathogenic complement gene mutations were found in 7 out of 8 patients tested (C3, MCP, or MCP combined with CFB or clusterin). Twenty out of 24 patients recovered completely, but 3 died (12%). Ten of the surviving patients underwent plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy, 5 plasma infusions. Influenza-mediated HUS or TTP is rare. A sizable proportion of tested patients demonstrated mutations associated with alternative pathway of complement dysregulation that was uncovered by this infection. Further research is warranted targeting the roles of viral neuraminidase, enhanced virus-induced complement activation and/or ADAMTS13 antibodies, and rational treatment approaches."

                            "Lyme disease is endemic to some parts of North America, and is an emerging disease in others. Although tick preventives are available, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is an increasingly common though controversial method used in the prevention of canine Lyme infection; reported efficacies of canine Lyme @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are highly variable, ranging from 50% to 100%. The objective of our research was as follows: to determine the efficacy of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for Borrelia burgdorferi in North American dogs by comparing @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end dogs to those not receiving the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. We used a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end to address this objective. Monovalent and multivalent @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were considered eligible interventions. Our main outcome of interest was the reduction of clinical illness following exposure to B. burgdorferi. Outcome data were extracted as a binary outcome for the following clinical signs (assessed separately): lameness, anorexia, pyrexia, depression, lymphadenopa-thy. Experimental and @hit_startanalytical@hit_end observational studies were considered eligible for inclusion. In addition to grey literature searches, the following electronic databases were searched with no language restrictions: @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts. The last search was performed on November 29, 2016. Thirteen challenge trials and three observational studies were identified as eligible, and twelve challenge trials contained sufficient data to be included in our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. A @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end could not be performed for observational studies due to an insufficient number of studies. None of the challenge trials assessed lymphadenopathy, but for each of the remaining four clinical signs a separate random effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was performed. With the exception of anorexia, all summary odds ratios were less than the null value of 1. Overall, the findings of our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end suggest that North American Lyme @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduce the odds of clinical illness in dogs following exposure to B. burgdorferi. However, these results should be interpreted with caution since a number of issues related to small sample size, study quality, and publication bias were identified. No experimental field trials were identified, highlighting a major gap in the literature on this topic. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes in field conditions."

                            "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) recipients are at an increased risk of infectious complications, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality post-transplant. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end of donors is one of the strategies that has been studied to improve immune reconstitution post-transplant, however the efficacy and safety of this strategy is not well @hit_startreviewed@hit_end in the @hit_startliterature@hit_end. In this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end we sought to evaluate the current strategies of donor @hit_startvaccination@hit_end along with their immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety. Utilizing strict selection criteria with defined MeSH terminology, an electronic search was conducted from the following databases: @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Database of @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end and Scopus. Abstracts of various professional society meetings were also screened and hand searching of various reviews and guideline articles was carried out. The full text of 52 articles were reviewed, from which 5 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria for effectiveness and immunogenicity trials and 1 article was included for safety data. Jadad score was used to assess the quality of included studies. The results of the included studies were inconsistent, and the studies were generally of suboptimal methodological quality. Most of the included studies (n = 3) investigated the use of more than one @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, however not all commonly used @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in HCT were investigated. None of the studies reported any long-term benefits for HCT recipients of @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end donors. Only one study reported safety data of using @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in donors. Given the suboptimal quality of the studies, and questionable effectiveness, donor @hit_startvaccination@hit_end cannot be recommended for all. Prospective high-quality @hit_startvaccine@hit_end trials in HCT donors are needed."

                            "Objectives: Our objective was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end the current evidence on long-term effectiveness and cost effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in Europe with specific interest on risk-adapted strategies. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search to identify decision-@hit_startanalytic@hit_end modelling studies assessing the cost effectiveness of cervical cancer screening strategies in Europe using relevant databases (@hit_startMedline@hit_end/@hit_startEmbase@hit_end/@hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library/CRD/EconLit). Study characteristics and results were summarized in standardized evidence tables. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), life-years gained (LYG), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Economic results were converted to 2015 Euros using the GDP-PPP and CPI. Results: Fourteen studies mostly from countries with population-based organized screening were eligible for inclusion. HPV-based screening was reported to be more effective in terms of patient-relevant outcomes compared to cytology alone independent of HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status. Overall, HPV-based screening strategies were considered to be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 Euro/LYG conditional on screening intervals of at least three years in non-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end women and at least five years in @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end women. HPV screening was mostly accompanied with a triage test for HPV-positive women. Most studies recommended starting screening at age 25 using cytology with cross over to HPV-based screening at age 30 years or older and ending screening at 65 years. While studies considering generic cancer risk aspects to restrict screening algorithms, further more personalized screening, follow-up strategies according to a woman\u2019s screening, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end history and taking into account other risk factors have not been evaluated. Conclusions: Our research suggests that HPV-based screening is more effective compared to cytology alone, and can be considered cost effective at screening intervals of at least 3 (non-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end) to 5 years (@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end women). Current risk-tailored screening programs are based on generic restrictions to a specific age and using triage or follow-up tests for HPV-positive women before referring to colposcopy directed biopsy."

                            "Objective. To develop recommendations for the assessment of people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Canada. Methods. Recommendations were developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. The Canadian SLE Working Group (panel of Canadian rheumatologists and a patient representative from Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance) was created. Questions for recommendation development were identified based on the results of a previous survey of SLE practice patterns of members of the Canadian Rheumatology Association. @hit_startSystematic literature reviews@hit_end of randomized trials and observational studies were conducted. Evidence to Decision tables were prepared and presented to the panel at 2 face-to-face meetings and online. Results. There are 15 recommendations for assessing and monitoring SLE, with varying applicability to adult and pediatric patients. Three recommendations focus on diagnosis, disease activity, and damage assessment, suggesting the use of a validated disease activity score per visit and annual damage score. Strong recommendations were made for cardiovascular risk assessment and measuring anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies in the peripartum period and conditional recommendations for osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. Two conditional recommendations were made for peripartum assessments, 1 for cervical cancer screening and 2 for hepatitis B and C screening. A strong recommendation was made for annual influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Conclusion. These are considered the first guidelines using the GRADE method for the monitoring of SLE. Existing evidence is largely of low to moderate quality, resulting in more conditional than strong recommendations. Additional rigorous studies and special attention to pediatric SLE populations and patient preferences are needed."

                            "Guinea-worm disease is a parasitic disease caused by Dracunculus medinensis. It affects people living in rural and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources for drinking water. Although it mortality is low, morbidity is considerably high and may cause huge disabilities which are devastating. Diagnosis is clinically performed, and no specific treatment nor @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are available. The objective of our review was to describe the epidemiology of Guinea-worm disease published cases. A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was conducted following the \u201cPRISMA\u201d guideline. @hit_startPubMed@hit_end database was searched using the search terms \u201cDracunculiasis\u201d or \u201cGuinea-worm disease\u201d and limited to case reports published in English or Spanish, but without time frame. Full text articles were assessed for relevance and data extraction was performed as an iterative process. During the initial search 26 articles were obtained, from which 19, containing 25 cases were included. Females were more affected than males (13 vs 12) and the medium age of presentation was of 25 years (+/-SD 16.69). The 67% of the patients came from Africa and Nigeria was the country which reported the most (36%). Pain (60%), swelling (36%) and fever (16%) were the most common initial clinical manifestations, and the presence of an ulcer containing the Guinea-worm was found during physical examination in only 40% of the cases. Diagnosis was most commonly done through histopathology (56%). Surgery was performed in 48% of the cases and mechanical extraction in 36%. The decision to do not perform no treatment at all was taken in 16% of the cases. Mortality rate was of 4%. Guinea-worm disease has been set as the first neglected tropical disease to be eradicated, and as it seems to come to an end, there are few case reports published in the literature. We consider that the trends presented in our @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, rather than being @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end from a historic point of view, should be taken as a lesson by health professionals to enhance the active surveillance of the remaining cases. No patient should be left behind and reemergence must be prevented."

                            "Background: The emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty pose a threat to the health of populations living in urban and low-income settings. A detailed understanding of intervention strategies, including effectiveness of past outbreak containment, is necessary to improve future practices. The objective was to determine what is known about the effectiveness of containment measures for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban settings and identify research gaps and implications for public health practice. Main body: We conducted a scoping @hit_startreview@hit_end and @hit_startsystematically@hit_end searched peer-@hit_startreviewed@hit_end and grey @hit_startliterature@hit_end published between 2000 and 2016. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction, and data on implementation process and transferability were extracted from all studies. A quality assessment was conducted for each included study. We screened 205 full-text articles and reports for a total of 31 articles included in the review. The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. The largest body of evidence concerned control activities for Ebola virus and dengue fever. The majority of interventions (87%) relied on multiple types of measures, which were grouped into four categories: 1) healthcare provision; 2) epidemiological investigation and/or surveillance; 3) environmental or sanitary interventions; and 4) community-based interventions. The quality of the majority of studies (90%) was poor or moderate, and one-third of the studies did not provide a clear description of the outcomes and of the procedures and/or tools used for the intervention. Conclusions: Our results highlight the difficulty of establishing causation when assessing the effect of containment measures. Studies that extend beyond solely reporting on effectiveness and take into account the complexity of real-world settings are urgently needed. We recommend the allocation of research efforts to the evaluation of the implementation processes of interventions as well as their comprehensive and systematic description using validated checklists."

                            "Objectives: Due to the high cost of pharmaceutical products, the European Union (EU) health care systems, particularly in low-resource settings, have begun to voluntarily enter cross-border collaborations in order to improve patient access to health technologies. The aim of this study was to identify and discuss the aims of the agreements and collaborations available across Europe as efforts made to address the challenges of the healthcare market. Methods: A @hit_startliterature review@hit_end through @hit_startPUBMED@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and additional websites, was conducted to identify policy initiatives and opportunities in EU countries. Results: Since 2012, 9 cross-border collaborations have been established in Europe: 4 collaborations focused on the procurement of innovative medicines: \u201cValletta Declaration\u201d (2017), \u201cSouthern European initiative\u201d (2016), \u201cNordic Pharmaceuticals Forum\u201d (2015) and \u201cBeNeLuxA\u201d (2015), and five collaborations aimed to facilitate the procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical devices: \u201cDeclaration of Sofia\u201d (2016), \u201cCentral Eastern European and South Eastern European Countries Initiative\u201d (2016), \u201cRomanian and Bulgarian Initiative\u201d (2015), and \u201cBaltic Partnership Agreement\u201d (2012). Through these collaborations, EU countries tend to centralize medicines purchase in order to present a bigger patient pool to pharmaceutical companies to facilitate lower prices and to ensure continuity of access. Their principal objectives were horizon scanning, information sharing, enhancing transparency and price negotiation. The first Baltic States\u2019 experience (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) in purchasing BCG @hit_startvaccine@hit_end failed in 2015 because no tender was submitted. Since 2015, there have been several successful joint purchasing of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end between Baltic countries (rotavirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end). Conclusions: Payers\u2019 collaboration can lead to lower drug prices and to development and collaboration on patient registries. However, establishing and implementing sustainable cross-border collaborations in procurement seems to be challenging. Experiences in Europe are still limited and too recent to allow clear conclusions to be derived on these collaborations\u2019 effectiveness and impact."

                            "Background and Aims: VIN is becoming an increasingly problematic disease especially in older women. Although spontaneous regression has been reported (1.2%) VIN/VaIN are considered premalignant conditions with a suggested progression rate greater than that of cervix cancer. Current treatments are inadequate with high recurrence rates therefore ongoing costs of care are high. As HPV DNA is found in over 80% of VIN/VAIN we wanted to @hit_startreview@hit_end the @hit_startliterature@hit_end regarding the role of HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the treatment of women with HPV related VIN/VAIN. Methods: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end. Our search included any type of study design using any form of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in the treatment of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of HPV related VIN and/or VAIN. We excluded studies of other anogenital disease, vulval/vaginal carcinoma and/or studies using @hit_startvaccines@hit_end as prophylaxis. The important clinical outcomes were lesion response to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, symptom improvement, immune response and HPV clearance. Results: We identified 93 articles - only 7 studies (129 women) met our inclusion criteria. Immunocompromised patients were excluded. These studies were all uncontrolled case series published between 2000 - 2017. There were no RCTs identified, and as none of the studies had control groups a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was not possible. Reduction in lesion size was reported by all 7 studies, symptom relief by only 4 studies, HPV clearance, histological regression, and immune response were reported by 6 studies. Follow up was short commonly from 6 months to 1 year. Conclusions: With the introduction of the HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in a primary prevention setting we should see a reduction in the incidence of VIN/VAIN. In the meantime, for patients who have not been @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end, newer treatments with fewer side effects and reduced morbidity are warranted. This review suggests @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effects on lesion size and symptom relief, however, the evidence is of low quality. More studies are required to investigate improved patient outcomes (symptoms and recurrence rates) with the use of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in a therapeutic setting."

                            "Background: This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end aims to describe the prevalence, trends, and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A (Spn19A) that causes invasive and non-invasive diseases in children <5 years in Latin-American and Caribbean countries. Methods: We searched for published (between January 2010 and February 2016) observational and clinical studies within the region including effectiveness and impact on Spn19A after pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PCV) introduction. We calculated prevalence estimates by country and standardized the frequency of isolates to conduct an interrupted time series @hit_startanalysis@hit_end for selected countries and to assess the potential changes in disease trends, overall and for Spn19A. Results: We identified and reviewed full-text of 89 publications and included 59 in the @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Data from the laboratory surveillance network, SIREVA, were included in 43 (74%) of the invasive pneumococcal disease reports. There are differences in the sensitivity, representativeness, and heterogeneity of laboratory surveillance. There has been and overall reduction in the trend and number of invasive S. pneumoniae isolates in children <5 years after PCVs introduction. To date, the prevalence of Spn19A has increased, however, there has been no observed change in the trend. Conclusions: This updated @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end provides evidence of a reduction in the total number of invasive pneumococcal disease isolates after the introduction of PCVs in the region but cannot yet conclude a change in the trend of Spn19A disease."

                            "Background: Men who have sex with men require special attention for human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end given elevated infection risks and the development of, in particular, @hit_startanal@hit_end cancer. Objective: Our purpose was to review the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for both currently @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-eligible@hit_end and non-eligible individuals, particularly the men-who-have-sex-with-men population, and synthesize the available evidence. Methods: We systematically searched for published articles in two main databases (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end). Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using a validated instrument (Bias in Economic Evaluation, ECOBIAS). Methodological aspects, study results, and sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were extracted and synthesized to generate a consistent overview of the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the men-who-have-sex-with-men population. Results: From 770 identified articles, four met the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominant to US$96,146 and US$14,000 to US$18,200 for tertiary prevention and primary prevention, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio seemed most sensitive to @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end costs, and the incidence of @hit_startanal@hit_end cancer in the selected target populations. Conclusion: This review presents the human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, both as a primary and adjuvant (tertiary) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, as a potentially cost-effective strategy for preventing mainly\u2014but not limited to only\u2014@hit_startanal@hit_end cancer in men-who-have-sex-with-men populations."
