                                "Context: The incidence of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is lower in women; however, women tend to present with more advanced disease. To date, there is no quantitative synthesis of studies reporting gender-specific outcomes in non\u2013muscle-invasive UCB. Objective: To conduct a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end evaluating gender-specific differences in recurrence of non\u2013muscle-invasive urinary bladder cancer (NMIBC). Evidence acquisition: An unrestricted systematic literature search of the @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end libraries was conducted. Studies evaluating the impact of gender on disease recurrence after local treatment of NMIBC using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were included. Random effect @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, @hit_startmeta@hit_end-influence, and cumulative @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end were conducted. Publication bias was assessed via a funnel plot and Egge\u0155s test. Evidence synthesis: Of 609 studies screened, 27 comprising 23 754 patients were included. Random effect @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end indicated women at increased risk for UCB recurrence compared with men (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01\u20131.23, p = 0.03). Subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end yielded estimates between HR = 0.99 and HR = 1.68. Gender-specific differences in UCB recurrence were most pronounced in studies administering exclusively bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG; HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13\u20132.39, p = 0.01), especially in a long-term treatment regimen (HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.32\u20132.15, p < 0.001). Sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end confirmed female patients at increased risk for UCB recurrence. Conclusions: Women are at increased risk for disease recurrence after local treatment of NMIBC compared with male patients. Reduced effectiveness of BCG treatment might underlie this observation. Gender-specific differences were evident across various subgroups and proved robust upon sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Patient summary: In this report, we combined several studies on gender-specific differences in relapse of superficial bladder cancer. Women were more likely to experience cancer relapse than men."

                                "Cancer constitutes a huge burden on societies in countries with any level of economic development. Prostate cancer is the first most diagnosed cancer of men in developed countries and the forth one in developing countries in terms of incidence rate. It is also the third incident cancer of men in Iran along with a prevalence of about 10,000 cases. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a severe stage of the disease with a number of newly discovered treatment options. These therapeutic alternatives including abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T, radiopharmaceuticals and bone-targeted therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab) along with docetaxel have made the decision making process complex and challenging for clinicians. In addition to the challenges of selecting the best-fit treatment, high costs of new pharmaceuticals and technologies necessitates the health policy-makers to develop practice guidelines in adaptation with local resources and limitations. The aim of this paper is to review the clinical guidelines for the management of CRPC. For better comprehension of guideline recommendations, the main clinical trials on new treatments were also identified. The efficacy and safety outcomes including but not limited to overall survival, progression free survival, quality of life and adverse effects were summarized. The guidelines of American Urological Association (AUA), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Association of Urology (EUA), Spanish Oncology Genitourinary Group (SOGG), Asian Oncology Summit, Saudi Oncology Society-Saudi Urology Association combined guideline, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Canadian Urological Association-Canadian Urologic Oncology Group (CUA-CUOG) were covered in this paper."

                                "Background: Non-operative management (NOM) of blunt hepatic and splenic injuries has become popular in haemodynamically stable adult patients, despite uncertainty about efficacy, patient selection, and details of management. Up-to-date strategies and practical recommendations are presented. Methods: A selective literature search was conducted in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library (1989\u20132016). Results: No randomized clinical trial was found. Non-randomized controlled trials and large retrospective and prospective series dominate. Few @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end are available. NOM of selected patients with blunt liver and spleen injuries is associated with low morbidity and mortality. Only data of limited evidence are available on intensity and duration of patient monitoring, repeat imaging, antithrombotic prophylaxis and return to normal activity. There is high-level evidence on early mobilisation and post-splenectomy @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Conclusion: NOM of blunt liver or spleen injuries is a worldwide trend, but the literature does not provide high-grade evidence for this strategy."

                                "Background: Apart from active allergen avoidance, immunotherapy is regarded as the most effective form of treatment available for type I allergies. Such treatments involve the administration of allergen preparations in various forms and by various routes. Virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a very effective platform for @hit_startimmunization@hit_end with the allergen and are characterized by high immunogenicity, low allergenicity and high clinical efficacy. Formulations that include Toll-like receptor ligands, T cell stimulatory epitopes and/or depot-forming adjuvants appear to enhance activation of the relevant immune cells. Short nucleotide sequences including CpG motifs have also been intensively explored as potent stimulators of dendritic cells and B cells. Methods: The present paper is based on a systematic literature search in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, and focuses on the pertinent immunological processes and on clinical data relating to use of VLPs and CpG motifs for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). Results: Many published studies have reported positive clinical results following administration of VLPs, either alone or in combination with CpG motifs and, in some cases, even in the absence of the allergen-specific allergen. Conclusions: These results indicate that VLPs modulate immune responses in ways which underline their exceptional promise as a platform for the immunotherapy of allergic disorders. However, clinical evaluations remain limited, and further large-scale and longer-term studies will be necessary to substantiate the efficacy and safety of these novel therapies."

                                "Objective: Children and adolescents are among the most vulnerable road users, and road traffic accidents (RTAs) can lead to not only physical injuries but also adverse psychological outcomes, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, estimates of the prevalence of PTSD among children and adolescents following RTAs varied considerably across studies. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of PTSD among this population. Methods: A systematic search for literature was performed in the electronic databases of @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Web of Science, @hit_startPsycINFO@hit_end, and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran\u2019s chi-square test and quantified by the I@sup_begin2@sup_end value. @hit_startMeta@hit_end-regression @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were carried out to identify the effects of some potential moderators on the overall heterogeneity. Subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence of PTSD according to some sample characteristics. Results: Eleven eligible studies with a total of 1532 children and adolescents who were involved in RTAs were included. The overall heterogeneity (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 89.7, P < 0.001) was high across the eligible studies, and the pooled prevalence of PTSD was 19.95% (95% confidence interval, 13.63% to 27.09%) by a random-effects model. No significant moderators of the overall heterogeneity were identified using @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end showed that the pooled prevalence of PTSD differed significantly according to the study location and gender (P < 0.05). Conclusions: One-fifth of children and adolescents developed PTSD in the aftermath of RTAs, indicating the need for regular assessment of PTSD and timely and effective psychological interventions among this population. Furthermore, more population-based studies with a large sample size are warranted. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (No. CRD42018087941)."

                                "Background: Erythema nodosum can be associated with a number of systemic diseases. There is, however, a paucity of information in the pediatric literature on this condition. The purpose of this article is to familiarize pediatricians with the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of erythema nodosum. Data sources: A @hit_startPubMed@hit_end search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \u201cerythema nodosum\u201d. Results: Clinically, erythema nodosum presents with a sudden onset of painful, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules mainly localized to the pretibial areas. Lesions are usually bilateral and symmetrical, ranging from 1 to 5 cm in diameter. Erythema nodosum may be associated with a variety of conditions such as infection, medications, sarcoidosis, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel disease, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, autoimmune disease, malignancy, and miscellaneous causes. The condition is idiopathic in approximately 50% of cases. The diagnosis is mainly clinical with biopsy reserved for atypical cases. To evaluate for the underlying cause, some basic laboratory screening studies are worthwhile in most cases and include a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein, throat swab culture, antistreptococcal O titers, and a chest radiograph. Other tests should be individualized, guided by the history and physical examination results. Most cases of erythema nodosum are self-limited and require no treatment. Bed rest and leg elevation are generally recommended to reduce the discomfort. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment for pain management. Conclusions: As erythema nodosum is often a cutaneous manifestation of a systemic disease, a thorough search should be performed to reveal the underlying cause."

                                "Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease in both adults and children. Whilst topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream, have proven efficacy for the treatment of AD, it is important to involve experts to obtain their opinion on its optimal treatment. Objective: Using a modified Delphi approach, this project aimed to generate consensus amongst experts on the use of TCIs in the treatment of AD, with a focus on the differentiation between tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. Methods: Six expert dermatologists from different European countries participated in this project based on their experience with AD and its treatment, which was evaluated by literature @hit_startanalysis@hit_end and expert opinion. Consensus amongst the experts was generated using a modified Delphi approach, consisting of three distinct phases, during which a web meeting (June 2017), two online rounds of blinded Delphi voting (July\u2013September 2017) and a face-to-face meeting (November 2017) were conducted. The consensus statements concerned two main topics: (i) Background of AD; and (ii) TCIs in AD. Hot topics in the treatment of AD not supported by @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, clinical trials or large observational studies were also discussed based on clinical experience. Results: In total, 25 consensus statements were defined and validated: eight statements on the general background of AD and 17 statements on the use of TCIs in AD, including their mechanism of action and therapeutic indications in AD, efficacy in adult and paediatric AD patients, pharmacokinetics, incidence of adverse events and safety concerns. Hot topics on the use of TCIs for the treatment of AD included cream vs. ointment, dosages, TCIs contact allergy, burning sensation management, superinfection and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end concerns. Conclusion: Topical calcineurin inhibitors are a suitable therapy for AD, and selection of the specific TCI should be based on factors which differentiate tacrolimus from pimecrolimus."

                                "OBJECTIVES: To appraise improvement strategies adopted by low- and middle-income countries to increase access to cancer treatments and palliative care; and identify the facilitators and barriers to implementation. METHODS: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was conducted and reported in accordance with PRISMA statement. @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library databases were searched. Bias was assessed using the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence, and evidence graded using the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council system. RESULTS: Of 3069 articles identified, 18 studied were included. These studies involved less than a tenth (n = 12, 8.6%) of all low- and middle-income countries. Most were case reports (58%), and the majority focused on palliative care (n = 11, 61%). Facilitators included: stakeholder engagement, financial support, supportive learning environment, and community networks. Barriers included: lack of human resources, financial constraints, and limited infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence on sustainable strategies for increasing access to cancer treatments and palliative care in low- and middle-income countries. Future strategies should be externally evaluated and be tailored to address service delivery; workforce; information; medical products, @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, and technologies; financing; and leadership and governance."

                                "Introduction: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD, septicaemia and/or meningitis) has a severe acute and long-term burden: 5\u201310% of patients die within 48 h, and long-term sequelae have been reported in 10\u201320% of survivors. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is increasingly but inconsistently assessed. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end on Neisseria meningitidis IMD sequelae and HRQoL in survivors of all ages and their caregivers, including family, was conducted for high-income countries from 2001 to 2016 (in @hit_startMedline@hit_end and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, following @hit_startCochrane@hit_end and PRISMA guidelines). Results: A total of 31 studies, mostly of childhood IMD cases, were included. A broad range of physical, neurological and psychological IMD sequelae were identified. The literature has evolved, with more types of sequelae reported in more recent studies; however, meningococcal disease-specific and sequelae-specific HRQoL data are lacking, and existing studies used a wide variety of instruments. Physical sequelae included: amputations (up to 8% of children, 3% adolescents/adults) and skin scars (up to 55% of children, 18% adolescents, 2% adults). Neurologic sequelae included: hearing loss (up to 19% of infants, 13% children, 12% adolescents, 8% adults). Psychological sequelae included: anxiety, learning difficulties, emotional and behavioural difficulties. IMD negatively affects HRQoL in patients and also in their family and close caregiver network, both in the short- and long-term. Even IMD survivors without sequelae experienced an adverse impact on HRQoL after many years, affecting self-esteem, physical, mental and psychosocial health, and HRQoL was worse in those with cognitive and behavioural sequelae. Conclusion: A high proportion of IMD survivors are affected by a broad range of sequelae and reduced HRQoL that persists years after infection. Childhood IMD survivors had more sequelae and more severe sequelae compared with adult survivors. HRQoL was affected in patients and also in their families, caregivers and surrounding network over the long term. More research is needed to resolve data gaps and to standardise HRQoL assessment.

                                "Introduction: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most commonly diagnosed Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) that is responsible for the majority of Cervical Cancer (CC) cases. Aim: The present study aimed to review HPV risk factors and prevention behaviours. Materials and Methods: In this study, articles indexed in databases, such as @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and Google Scholar were reviewed. In total, 29 papers on the risk factors and the associated prevention methods in this area were evaluated. Results: Risk factors and prevention of HPV infection were classified into three domains: individual, behavioural, and psychosocial. There were differences with regard to age, race, marriage and the number of pregnancies, in the individual domain. In the behavioural domain, conflicting evidence was found on oral contraceptives and the use of condom. In the psychosocial domain, the main risk factors for HPV include: believing in fatalities of the cancer, the shame of the disease, and fear of vaginal examination. Meanwhile, the fear of developing HPV led to the prevention of high risk behaviours. Conclusion: Given the limited research on risk factors or HPV prevention in Iran and the contradictions observed in the results of studies, there is a need for further investigations to obtain basic information on risk factors and prevention. In this regard, widespread health education is a necessity for raising the awareness of individuals about HPV infection prevention."
