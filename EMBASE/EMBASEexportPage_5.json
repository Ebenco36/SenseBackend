                            "Introduction: The prevalence of group A streptococcal (GAS) disease is estimated at >18.1 million cases with an incidence of >1.78 million cases py. While GAS is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity on the global scale, the burden of GAS disease in Africa is not known. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in a number of databases, using an African search filter to identify published studies of GAS prevalence amongst symptomatic patients. Two reviewers independently selected articles meeting pre-specified criteria and extracted data on a standardised data extraction form. Statistical @hit_startanalysis@hit_end included the identification of data sources, documenting estimates, and the application of the random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end model to aggregate prevalence estimates 95% CI for GAS. We applied Freeman-Tukey transformation to account for between study variability. The I2 statistic was used to determine the extent of variation in effect estimates due to heterogeneity (H0). Results: Of 128 articles identified, 27 met the inclusion criteria. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end revealed a pooled prevalence of 23% (95% CI, 20-27%). Regional pooled prevalences were similar between Western, 25% (95% CI, 23-27%) and Northern Africa, 26% (95% CI, 21-31%). Central and Eastern Africa had the lowest pooled estimate of 5% (95% CI, 2-11%) and 16% (95% CI, 8-27%) respectively, while Southern Africa had the highest pooled estimate of 32% (95% CI, 20- 46%). Two articles reported on molecular characterisation of isolates with 92 emm-types documented; the most dominant subtypes were emm44, 48 and 65. Conclusion: The prevalence of GAS is high in Africa. Efforts focused on the primary prevention of GAS pharyngitis are therefore warranted. Data on molecular strain characterization of GAS in Africa is largely non-existent and thus there is a need for further studies such as AFROStrep to inform current prevention efforts including @hit_startvaccine@hit_end development."

                            "Background: Equity remains a priority in the international health development agenda. However, major inequities in @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage jeopardise the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We aim at comprehensively describing how research has addressed equity issues related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods: We carried out an @hit_startoverview@hit_end of @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end (SRs) that explicitly explored the effects of interventions to improve @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in any context; for any @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and, in any language. We followed standard research synthesis methods to systematically search for SR, assess them for inclusion and extracting relevant data, particularly on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end related outcomes. To gather evidence on equity issues addressed in the SR, we used the PROGRESS-plus framework. Findings: Our search obtained 2,003 hits which resulted in 54 included SRs, published between 1994 and 2014. The quality of SRs was generally poor, with less than half complying with most of the quality criteria. Reported @hit_startvaccines@hit_end included, by order of frequency, influenza and Expanded Programme on @hit_startImmunisation vaccines@hit_end. The types of interventions more frequently reported were related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end delivery strategies, financial support and information, education and communication. Most of the SRs suggested effects favouring intervention groups as opposed to comparison groups. The most frequently reported equity attribute was \u2018place of residence\u2019 and the least reported equity attributes were sexual orientation and religion. Very few estimates of effects actually measured differences or changes between groups having those attributes and all of them referred to the place of residence. No data was found about reducing equity gaps for vulnerable groups or minorities, or attributes such as sexual orientation, education or specific religious groups. Conclusions: Although research on vulnerable populations as a subgroup is abundant, it fails to report on the interventions that will actually reduce inequities and consider how redistribution of health care resources could shrink the gap between the privileged and most vulnerable groups including minorities. Research, if aiming at being responsive to global health policy trends, needs to report not only on specific attributes but also on how a better redistribution of health care resources could contribute to alleviating the unjust situation of the most vulnerable populations."

                            "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections are recognized as a significant source of morbidity for military populations, particularly for recruits. This @hit_startanalysis@hit_end aims to describe the pneumonia burden at Marine Corps Recruit Depots (MCRD) in Parris Island and San Diego during 2007-2014, as these two depots maintain noteworthy comparisons in @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and prophylaxis policies. First, both depots reinstated the adenovirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in October 2011. Second, San Diego provides the pneumococcal polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to all recruits within the first 2 days of arrival, although Parris Island does not routinely @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Third, recruits at San Diego routinely receive three doses of penicillin G benzathine for group A Streptococcus bacterium prophylaxis, although those at Parris Island receive one dose year-round and a second dose during the winter months when group A Streptococcus bacterium burden is expected to increase.",
                            "METHODS: Monthly pneumonia rates were estimated using diagnostic codes from ambulatory encounters and inpatient discharge records, and specific causative organisms were assessed using code extenders within the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. Regression @hit_startanalyses@hit_end and Spearman's correlation rank tests were used to describe significant trends and the relationship between ambulatory and inpatient rates at each depot.",
                            "FINDINGS: Although our results indicate the majority of ambulatory encounters and inpatient discharges are attributed to unspecified pneumonia diagnostic codes at both locations, these data still lend noteworthy trends. At both locations, linear trends in ambulatory pneumonia rates significantly declined over the 8-year period, whereas inpatient rates demonstrated less variability and did not significantly decline. Both depots experienced prolonged, heightened pneumonia trends from early 2009-2010, a period which included the global influenza pandemic. Following reimplementation of the adenovirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end during October 2011, the average ambulatory rates at MCRD San Diego (38.02 per 1,000 recruit-months vs. 65.59 per 1,000 recruit-months) and MCRD Parris Island (10.9 per 1,000 recruit-months vs. 22.8 per 1,000 recruit-months) were approximately half the average rate before utilization of the adenovirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. At MCRD San Diego, a weak correlation between monthly inpatient and ambulatory pneumonia rates suggests that trends for potentially severe pneumonia do not follow those for generalized disease (rs = 0.43; p < 0.05), whereas correlation results at MCRD Parris Island indicate these monthly trends are positively associated (rs = 0.71; p < 0.05).",
                            "DISCUSSION: These observations underscore the evidence that pneumonia burden among military recruits is not associated with one single etiology. Recruits are at risk for a range of etiologic agents, and control measures should include a combination of specific medical countermeasures that focus on a single bacterial or viral disease as well as nonmedical public health measures that reduce the overall burden of circulating infectious respiratory agents. The trends described in this report, coupled with the similarities and dissimilarities for public health prevention practices at each depot, may warrant further investigation for a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of social and environmental factors within recruit populations at these two locations."

                            "Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of deaths among children <5 years of age. Studies have suggested that group B Streptococcus (GBS) maternal rectovaginal colonization during pregnancy may be a risk factor for preterm delivery. This article is the fifth of 11 in a series. We aimed to assess the association between GBS maternal colonization and preterm birth in order to inform estimates of the burden of GBS. Methods. We conducted @hit_startsystematic literature reviews@hit_end (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end/@hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpublished data from investigator groups on the association of preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation) and maternal GBS colonization (GBS isolation from vaginal, cervical, and/or rectal swabs; with separate subanalysis on GBS bacteriuria). We did @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end to derive pooled estimates of the risk and odds ratios (according to study design), with sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end to investigate potential biases. Results. We identified 45 studies for inclusion. We estimated the risk ratio (RR) for preterm birth with maternal GBS colonization to be 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI],.99-1.48; P =.061) in cohort and cross-sectional studies, and the odds ratio to be 1.85 (95% CI, 1.24-2.77; P =.003) in case-control studies. Preterm birth was associated with GBS bacteriuria in cohort studies (RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.45-2.69]; P <.001). Conclusions. From this review, there is evidence to suggest that preterm birth is associated with maternal GBS colonization, especially where there is evidence of ascending infection (bacteriuria). Several biases reduce the chance of detecting an effect. Equally, however, results, including evidence for the association, may be due to confounding, which is rarely addressed in studies. Assessment of any effect on preterm delivery should be included in future maternal GBS @hit_startvaccine@hit_end trials."

                            "World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2013 that 49,000 deaths all over the world were caused by neonatal tetanus. Only as recently as the year 2000, neonatal tetanus was a public health problem in 59 countries, but since then it has been eliminated in 36 of the countries concerned. The objective of this piece of work, therefore, was to investigate which strategies intended to increase demand for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end are effective in increasing anti-tetanus @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage of women in Sub Saharan Africa. We searched the following electronic databases from January 1989 to July 2016: @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (Excerpta Medica Database), The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, Google Scholar, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), WHOLIS (World Health Organization Library Database), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences) and contacted experts in the field. There were no restrictions to language or publication status. All study designs that could provide the information we sought were eligible, provided the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Critical appraisal of all identified citations was done independently by two authors to establish the possible relevance of the articles for inclusion in the review. Our search strategy yielded 191 records and after assessment for eligibility, 6 papers met the criteria for inclusion. In Ivory Coast, after reorganization, health workers said they were satisfied with the work environment and the care provided in 91% and 96% of cases, respectively. In Kenya, the main factors contributing to having sufficiently @hit_startimmunized@hit_end part of the population against tetanus are lower birth order, higher household wealth index, women's employment, making joint health-related decisions with a partner, and higher number of antenatal care visits. Particularly in Ethiopia, compared with other member countries, the size of the unimmunized population, reporting quality, fragileness of the health system, resource limitation, and others deserve further concerted attention. In Nigeria, the prevalence of missed opportunities was 66%. The factors responsible for missed opportunities were; poor history taking, lack of knowledge of the current @hit_startimmunization@hit_end schedule, dependence on physician referral for @hit_startimmunization@hit_end and inefficient @hit_startimmunization@hit_end records keeping system. In Nigeria, socio-logistic variables found to be important in Expanded Programme on @hit_startImmunization@hit_end implementations included scheduling, health staff attitude, intersectoral collaboration, and health education. Lack of community participation was also found to be a crucial constraining factor. There are many challenges to increase @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage of tetanus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for women. So far very few interventions addressing these challenges have been evaluated scientifically. Community mobilization interventions to change or impact beliefs and attitudes of women are absolutely needed. Additionally, improving accessibility, affordability, availability and accommodation of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end service venues will make them more attractive."

                            "Introduction: @hit_startImmunization@hit_end of the pediatric population is a preventive strategy for infectious-contagious diseases that has proven to be effective, however, in the presence of a birth defect such as congenital heart disease (CHD), this process happens to second term and staff of health that initiates the basic scheme of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end does not always know the benefits, indications and contraindications of the same. Objective: To identify and characterize publications related to @hit_startimmunization@hit_end in the pediatric patient with CHD. Methodology: A systematized review with an integrative methodology of the evidence was carried out with a qualitative and descriptive approach. In the databases CUIDEN, LILACS, SciELO and @hit_startMedline@hit_end a search and selection of the publications related to the @hit_startimmunization@hit_end of the pediatric patient with CHD; included scientific articles, full text, Spanish, English and Portuguese language published in 2011-2015. Data collected with a table of ex-profeso evidence. The articles were subjected to a content @hit_startanalysis@hit_end to construct the category: prophylactic @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. Results: Of the 8 articles selected, most were published in the United States of America (37.5%), English language (87.5%); 75% with level of evidence IV and degree of recommendation C. @hit_startVaccines@hit_end applied in infants up to two years of age; effective prophylactic @hit_startimmunization@hit_end against influenza, pneumococcus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella. Conclusions: Prophylactic @hit_startimmunization@hit_end of pediatric patients with CHD is related to respiratory tract diseases and has shown that it may be potentially effective, but more rigorous and methodological studies are needed, including @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against tuberculosis, hepatitis, poliomyelitis, among others."

                            "METHODS: We collated data from administrative reports, population-based surveys and other sources and used them to produce annual estimates of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage. We investigated bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, the first and third doses of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, the third dose of oral polio @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and the first dose of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against measles. We obtained relevant data covering the period 1999-2013 for each of 16 states and territories and the period 2001-2013 for the state of Jharkhand - which was only created in 2000. We aggregated the resultant state-level estimates, using a population-weighted approach, to give national values.",
                            "FINDINGS: For each of the @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end we investigated, about half of the 253 estimates of annual coverage at state level that we produced were based on survey results. The rest were based on interpolation between - or extrapolation from - so-called anchor points or, more rarely, on administrative data. Our national estimates indicated that, for each of the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end we investigated, coverage gradually increased between 1999 and 2010 but then levelled off.",
                            "CONCLUSION: The delivery of routine @hit_startvaccination@hit_end services to Indian children appears to have improved between 1999 and 2013. There remains considerable scope to improve the recording and reporting of childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage in India and regular @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end of the coverage data are recommended."

                            "BACKGROUND: Childhood pneumonia is a major cause of childhood illness and the second leading cause of child death globally. Understanding the costs associated with the management of childhood pneumonia is essential for resource allocation and priority setting for child health.",
                            "METHODS: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end to identify studies reporting data on the cost of management of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old. We collected unpublished cost data on non-severe, severe and very severe pneumonia through collaboration with an international working group. We extracted data on cost per episode, duration of hospital stay and unit cost of interventions for the management of pneumonia. The mean (95% confidence interval, CI) and median (interquartile range, IQR) treatment costs were estimated and reported where appropriate.",
                            "RESULTS: We identified 24 published studies eligible for inclusion and supplemented these with data from 10 unpublished studies. The 34 studies included in the cost @hit_startanalysis@hit_end contained data on more than 95 000 children with pneumonia from both low- and-middle income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC) covering all 6 WHO regions. The total cost (per episode) for management of severe pneumonia was US$ 4.3 (95% CI 1.5-8.7), US$ 51.7 (95% CI 17.4-91.0) and US$ 242.7 (95% CI 153.6-341.4)-559.4 (95% CI 268.9-886.3) in community, out-patient facilities and different levels of hospital in-patient settings in LMIC. Direct medical cost for severe pneumonia in hospital inpatient settings was estimated to be 26.6%-115.8% of patients' monthly household income in LMIC. The mean direct non-medical cost and indirect cost for severe pneumonia management accounted for 0.5-31% of weekly household income. The mean length of stay (LOS) in hospital for children with severe pneumonia was 5.8 (IQR 5.3-6.4) and 7.7 (IQR 5.5-9.9) days in LMIC and HIC respectively for these children.",
                            "CONCLUSION: This is the most comprehensive review to date of cost data from studies on the management of childhood pneumonia and these data should be helpful for health services planning and priority setting by national programmes and international agencies."

                            "Background: Advances in high-throughput omics technologies allow us to quantify global cellular changes in DNA, RNA, proteins or metabolites under various experimental conditions or disease states. One active area of research is to develop methodology for integrating these large datasets to improve our mechanistic understanding and provide systems-level insights into cellular function. Furthermore, data integration can increase our statistical power as well as removing study bias. Here, we present NetworkAnalyst [1, 2], an interactive, webbased tool for biologists to perform complex @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, visual data mining and data integration. Methods: There are two common approaches to data integration: (1) horizontal data integration, which combines different data sets from the same omic approach, such as performing @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of gene expression changes to identify expression signatures; and (2) vertical data integration, which seeks to coalesce different omic data sets, such as integrating transcriptomic and metabolomics data to identify perturbation in pathways of interest. To link these different datasets, NetworkAnalyst mines InnateDB [3] for curated protein-protein interactions (PPI) and creates biologically meaningful networks. Network topology @hit_startanalysis@hit_end can be used to identify those protein nodes that are highly connected (i.e. hubs), which can serve as useful biomarkers or therapeutic targets; while densely connected units (i.e. modules) that show strong differential expression patterns can be used to identify unique disease signatures. Results: Using NetworkAnalyst, we can generate novel hypotheses on various aspects of immune regulation, from neonatal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end response to common mis-regulation that contributes to inflammatory diseases such as asthma, Vasculitis and sepsis. For instance, we typically identify mis-regulated modules containing S100 protein family members in patients with inflammatory disorder. In patients who developed sepsis, we observed up-regulation in S100A8 and S100A9 genes and down-regulation in S100A4 gene [4]. A number of these S100 proteins have emerged as potential biomarkers in independent studies [5]. In contrast, we used NetworkAnalyst to overlay proteomic data onto transcriptomic networks to characterize neonatal response to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. We observed the up-regulation of a key immune hub, STAT1, in our transcriptome @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Independently, we identified known STAT1 PPI in our proteomic @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Together, our data suggest STAT1 may play an important role in @hit_startimmunization@hit_end response against viral @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Conclusions: Biological network @hit_startanalysis@hit_end is a powerful approach to study complex diseases, and can be an invaluable tool for biomarker discovery and the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions."

                            "Background: Because immunological aberrations might be the cause of miscarriage in some women, several immunotherapies have been used to treat women with otherwise unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any immunotherapy, including paternal leukocyte @hit_startimmunization@hit_end and intravenous immunoglobulin on the live birth rate in women with previous unexplained recurrent miscarriages. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (11 February 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomized trials of immunotherapies used to treat women with three or more prior miscarriages and no more than one live birth after, in whom all recognized non-immunologic causes of recurrent miscarriage had been ruled out and no simultaneous treatment was given. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: The review author and the two co-authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality for all studies considered for this review. Main results: Twenty trials of high quality were included. The various forms of immunotherapy did not show significant differences between treatment and control groups in terms of subsequent live births: paternal cell @hit_startimmunization@hit_end (12 trials, 641 women), Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.70; third-party donor cell @hit_startimmunization@hit_end (three trials, 156 women), Peto OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.82; trophoblast membrane infusion (one trial, 37 women), Peto OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.45; or intravenous immunoglobulin, (eight trials, 303 women), Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.58. Authors' conclusions: Paternal cell @hit_startimmunization@hit_end, third-party donor leukocytes, trophoblast membranes, and intravenous immunoglobulin provide no significant beneficial effect over placebo in improving the live birth rate."

                            "Background: Viral respiratory tract infections in people with cystic fibrosis have a deteriorating effect on their lung function and disease progression. Annual influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is therefore commonly recommended for people with cystic fibrosis. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted the companies which market the influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end used in the trials to obtain further information about randomised controlled trials. Date of the most recent search of the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 08 July 2013. Selection criteria: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials (published or unpublished) comparing any influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end with a placebo or with another type of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Additional information was obtained by contacting the investigators when it was indicated. Main results: Four studies enrolling a total of 179 participants with cystic fibrosis (143 (80%) were children aged 1 to 16 years) were included in this review. There was no study comparing a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to a placebo or a whole virus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to a subunit or split virus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Two studies compared an intranasal applied live @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to an intramuscular inactivated @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and the other two studies compared a split virus to a subunit @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and a virosome to a subunit @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (all intramuscular). The incidence of all reported adverse events was high depending on the type of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. The total adverse event rate ranged from 48 out of 201 participants (24%) for the intranasal live @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to 13 out of 30 participants (43%) for the split virus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. With the limitation of a statistical low power there was no significant difference between the study @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end. None of the events were severe. All study influenza @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end generated a satisfactory serological antibody response. No study reported other clinically important benefits. Authors' conclusions: There is currently no evidence from randomised studies that influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end given to people with cystic fibrosis is of benefit to them. There remains a need for a well-constructed clinical study, that assesses the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on important clinical outcome measures."

                            "Background: Acute splenic sequestration crises are a complication of sickle cell disease, with high mortality rates and frequent recurrence in survivors of first attacks. Splenectomy and blood transfusion, with their consequences, are the mainstay of long-term management used in different parts of the world. Objectives: To assess whether splenectomy (total or partial), to prevent acute splenic sequestration crises in people with sickle cell disease, improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with sickle cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusions. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional trials were sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search strategy. Date of the most recent search: 06 December 2012. Selection criteria: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing splenectomy (total or partial) to prevent recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises with no treatment or blood transfusions in people with sickle cell disease. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. Main results: No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. Authors' conclusions: Splenectomy, if full, will prevent further sequestration and if partial, may reduce the recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises. However, there is a lack of evidence from trials showing that splenectomy improves survival and decreases morbidity in people with sickle cell disease. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to December 2012. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published."
