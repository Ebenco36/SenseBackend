                                "Introduction Globally, some studies show a resurgence of pertussis. The risks and benefits of using whole-cell pertussis (wP) or acellular pertussis (aP) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in the control of the disease have been widely debated. Better control of pertussis will require improved understanding of the immune response to pertussis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Improved understanding and assessment of the @hit_startimmunity@hit_end induced by pertussis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end is thus imperative. Several studies have documented different immunological outcomes to pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end from an array of assays. We propose to conduct a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the different immunological assays and outcomes used in the assessment of the humoraland cell-mediated immune response following pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end The primary outcomes for consideration are quality and quantity of immune responses (humoral and cell-mediated) post-pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Of interest as secondary outcomes are types of immunoassays used in assessing immune responses post-pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, types of biological samples used in assessing immune responses post-pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, as well as the types of antigens used to stimulate these samples during post-pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end immune response assessments. Different electronic databases (including @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end, EBSCO Host, Scopus and Web of Science) will be accessed for peer-reviewed published and grey literature evaluating immune responses to pertussis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end between 1990 and 2019. The quality of included articles will be assessed using standardised risk and quality assessment tools specific to the study design used in each article. Data extraction will be done using a data extraction form. The extracted data will be @hit_startanalysed@hit_end using STATA V.14.0 and RevMan V.5.3 software. A subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end will be conducted based on the study population, type of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (wP or aP) and type of immune response (cell-mediated or humoral). Guidelines for reporting @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end in the revised 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end and @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-Analysis@hit_end (PRISMA) statement will be used in this study. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required for this study as it is a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end. We will only make use of data already available in the public space. Findings will be reported via publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at scientific meetings and workshops. Trial registration number CRD42018102455."

                                "Objective: Bereavement is associated with increased risk for morbidity and all-cause mortality across epidemiological, @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analytic@hit_end, and case-control studies. The body of research examining the association between bereavement and immune function, beginning in 1977, has yet to be reviewed. The current @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end clarifies these findings, identifies limitations of the diverse literature, and suggests a model and directions for future research. Methods: The PRISMA guidelines for @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end were used to synthesize 41 years of research. Compared with a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end is appropriate given the heterogeneous nature of the studies. We used the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Study Quality Assessment Tool to assess the quality of select studies. Results: Thirty-three publications met inclusion criteria. Most studies support the association between bereavement and maladaptive changes in immune parameters in adults, with mixed findings on bereavement-related changes in cellular @hit_startimmunity@hit_end. A handful of recent, good-quality studies show bereaved people demonstrate higher levels of systemic inflammation, maladaptive immune cell gene expression, and lower antibody response to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end compared with nonbereaved controls. Individual differences in psychological response to bereavement (e.g., depression, grief) seem to influence the association between bereavement and immune function. Conclusions: Research examining the association between bereavement and biomarkers of immune function is heterogeneous in methods and quality. Despite these limitations, there is evidence supporting maladaptive changes in immune function after bereavement. The research area would benefit from longitudinal research with larger sample sizes, advanced immunological methods, and incorporating measures of psychological responses to bereavement. The field is poised to refine and scale up its investigation of this common and important phenomenon."

We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on the ability of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to protect against disease, as measured by antibody responses. Methods: Electronic databases (@hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startPsychINFO@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end)were searched from their inception to 6th February 2018. Results: The search yielded 9 eligible trials conducted with 1603 participants and four broad categories of intervention: meditation/mindfulness (n = 3), massage (n = 3), expressive writing (n = 2)and cognitive behavioural stress management (n = 1). Some evidence of benefit on the antibody response to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was observed in 6/9 of all trials and in 4/7 of randomised controlled trials. However, effects on antibody levels were often mixed, with only 3 of 6 trials showing benefit demonstrating an improvement in all antibody outcomes and at all time points assessed. Trials demonstrating benefit also provided direct or indirect evidence of adequate adherence with the intervention; and in 50% of these trials, there was also evidence that the intervention was effective in changing the mediating psychological constructs targeted by the intervention. Conclusions: This literature is characterised by considerable heterogeneity in terms of intervention type, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end type, age of participants and the temporal relationship between @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and intervention. We conclude that there is early evidence to suggest that psychological interventions may enhance the antibody response to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. However, the effects are inconsistent, with the greatest likelihood of benefit seen in trials evidencing adequate adherence with the intervention. Future work would benefit from rigorous intervention development that focuses on achieving adequate adherence and large well-controlled randomised trials with a focus on an agreed set of outcomes."

                                "Background Prior to introducing pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (PCVs), Streptococcus pneumoniae was most commonly isolated from middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media (AOM). Reducing nasopharyngeal colonisation of this bacterium by PCVsmay lead to a decline in AOM. The effects of PCVs deserve ongoing monitoring since studies from the post-PCV era report a shift in causative otopathogens towards non-@hit_startvaccine@hit_end serotypes and other bacteria. This updated @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Review was first published in 2002 and updated in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The review title was changed (to include the population, i.e. children) for this update. Objectives To assess the effect of PCVs in preventing AOM in children up to 12 years of age. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, LILACS,Web of Science, and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 29 March 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of PCV versus placebo or control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end We used the standard methodological procedures expected by @hit_startCochrane@hit_end. The primary outcomes were frequency of all-cause AOMand adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included frequency of pneumococcal AOMand frequency of recurrent AOM(defined as three or more AOM episodes in six months or four or more in one year). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results We included 14 publications of 11 trials (60,733 children, range 74 to 37,868 per trial) of 7- to 11-valent PCVs versus control @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (meningococcus type C @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in three trials, and hepatitis A or B @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in eight trials). We included two additional trials for this update. We did not find any relevant trials with the newer 13-valent PCV. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Overall, risk of bias was low. In seven trials (59,415 children) PCVs were administered in early infancy, while four trials (1318 children) included children aged one year and over who were either healthy or had a history of respiratory illness. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity across studies, therefore we did not perform @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end. Adverse events Nine trials reported on adverse effects (77,389 children; high-quality evidence). Mild local reactions and fever were common in both groups, and occurred more frequently in PCV than in control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end groups: redness (< 2.5 cm): 5% to 20% versus 0% to 16%; swelling (< 2.5 cm): 5% to 12% versus 0% to 8%; and fever (< 39 \u00b0C): 15% to 44% versus 8% to 25%. More severe redness (> 2.5 cm), swelling (> 2.5 cm), and fever (> 39 \u00b0C) occurred less frequently (0% to 0.9%, 0.1% to 1.3%, and 0.4% to 2.5%, respectively in children receiving PCV) and did not differ significantly between PCV and control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end groups. Pain or tenderness, or both was reported more frequently in PCV than in control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end groups: 3% to 38% versus 0% to 8%. Serious adverse events judged causally related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were rare and did not differ significantly between groups, and no fatal serious adverse event judged causally related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was reported. PCV administered in early infancy PCV7 The effect of a licenced 7-valent PCV with CRM197 as carrier protein (CRM197-PCV7) on all-cause AOM varied from -5% (95% confidence interval (CI) -25% to 12%) relative risk reduction (RRR) in high-risk infants (1 trial; 944 children; moderate-quality evidence) to 6% (95% CI -4% to 16%; 1 trial; 1662 children) and 6% (95% CI 4% to 9%; 1 trial; 37,868 children) RRR in lowrisk infants (high-quality evidence). PCV7 with the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B as carrier protein (OMPC-PCV7), was not associated with a reduction in all-cause AOM (RRR -1%, 95% CI -12% to 10%; 1 trial; 1666 children; high-quality evidence). CRM197-PCV7 and OMPC-PCV7 were associated with 20% (95% CI 7% to 31%) and 25% (95% CI 11% to 37%) RRR in pneumococcal AOM, respectively (2 trials; 3328 children; high-quality evidence) and CRM197-PCV7 with 9% (95% CI -12% to 27%) to 10% (95% CI 7% to 13%) RRR in recurrent AOM (2 trials; 39,530 ldren; high-quality evidence). PHiD-CV10/11 The effect of a licenced 10-valent PCV conjugated to protein D, a surface lipoprotein of Haemophilus influenzae, (PHiD-CV10) on all-cause AOM varied from 6% (95% CI -6% to 17%; 1 trial; 5095 children) to 15% (95% CI -1% to 28%; 1 trial; 7359 children) RRR in healthy infants (moderate-quality evidence). PHiD-CV11 was associated with 34% (95% CI 21% to 44%) RRR in all-cause AOM (1 trial; 4968 children; high-quality evidence). PHiD-CV10 and PHiD-CV11were associatedwith 53%(95%CI 16%to 74%) and 52%(95%CI 37%to 63%)RRRin pneumococcal AOM (2 trials; 12,327 children; high-quality evidence) and PHiD-CV11 with 56% (95% CI -2% to 80%) RRR in recurrent AOM (1 trial; 4968 children; moderate-quality evidence). PCV administered at later age PCV7 We found no evidence of a beneficial effect on all-cause AOM of administering CRM197-PCV7 in children aged 1 to 7 years with a history of respiratory illness or frequent AOM (2 trials; 457 children; high-quality evidence) and CRM197-PCV7 combined with a trivalent influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in children aged 18 to 72 months with a history of respiratory tract infections (1 trial; 597 children; highquality evidence). CRM197-PCV9 In 1 trial including 264 healthy day-care attendees aged 1 to 3 years, CRM197-PCV9 was associated with 17% (95% CI -2% to 33%) RRR in parent-reported all-cause OM (low-quality evidence). Administration of the licenced CRM197-PCV7 and PHiD-CV10 during early infancy is associated with large relative risk reductions in pneumococcal AOM. However, the effects of these @hit_startvaccines@hit_end on all-cause AOM is far more uncertain. We found no evidence of a beneficial effect on all-cause AOMof administering PCVs in high-risk infants, after early infancy (i.e. in children one year and above), and in older children with a history of respiratory illness. Compared to control @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, PCVs were associated with an increase in mild local reactions (redness, swelling), fever, and pain and/or tenderness. We found no evidence of a difference in more severe local reactions, fever, or serious adverse events judged causally related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end."

                                "Introduction: Although a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end disease, influenza causes approximately 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000\u2013650,000 deaths worldwide, which occur primarily among people 65 years and older. Nonetheless, prevention of influenza and its complications rely mainly on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. We aimed to systematically evaluate influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness at reducing healthcare utilization in older adults, defined as the reduction of outpatient visits, ILI and influenza hospitalizations, utilization of antibiotics and cardiovascular events by @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status during the influenza season. Methods: We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and considered any seasonal influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, excluding the pandemic (2009\u201310 season) @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Reviewers independently assessed data extraction and quality assessment. Results: Of the 8308 citations retrieved, 22 studies were included in the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end. Overall, two studies (9%) were deemed at moderate risk of bias, thirteen (59%) at serious risk of bias and seven (32%) at critical risk of bias. For outpatient visits, we found modest evidence of protection by the influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. For all-cause hospitalization outcomes, we found a wide range of results, mostly deemed at serious risk of bias. The included studies suggested that the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end may protect older adults against influenza hospitalizations and cardiovascular events. No article meeting our inclusion criteria explored the use of antibiotics and ILI hospitalizations. The high heterogeneity between studies hindered the aggregation of data into a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Conclusion: The variability between studies prevented us from drawing a clear conclusion on the effectiveness of the influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end on healthcare utilization in older adults. Overall, the data suggests that the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end may result in a reduction of healthcare utilization in the older population. Further studies of higher quality are necessary."

                                "Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is associated with a high morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are currently >98 known serotypes; the most burdensome are covered by current pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (PCVs) such as PCV10 (Synflorix\u00ae) and (Prevnar 13\u00ae) PCV13. However, at present no PCV is available on the National Expanded Programme of @hit_startImmunization@hit_end (EPI) in Thailand. Methods: Here we report a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of studies regarding pneumococci associated with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-IPD in Thailand. The NCBI @hit_startPubMed@hit_end database and Google Scholar were used to identify relevant papers published from 1st January 1990 to 21st August 2017. The quantitative @hit_startanalysis@hit_end was reported as the distribution of serotypes across two age groups, \u22645 and >5 years old, as these were the most commonly reported. Where age was not stated, or data was combined, data were categorised as all ages. Results: The search returned 15 relevant articles. From these the five most common disease-causing serotypes, in rank order, were 6B, 23F, 14, 19A and 19F. @hit_startVaccine@hit_end coverage would be 55.3% for PCV10 and 69.7% for PCV13. There was insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding non-invasive disease-causing pneumococcal serotypes. Conclusion: This review demonstrates that the serotypes which were most responsible for disease in Thailand are included in PCV10 and PCV13. Better surveillance data of IPD and non-IPD are required for monitoring @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness if PCV is implemented nationally."

                                "Background: Previous studies examining the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) show inconsistent results in different endemic areas. Furthermore, studies evaluating the association between stratified HBV status and NHL with a well-matched case-control design are rare. Methods: We conducted a 1:2 case-control study enrolling 3502 NHL cases and 7004 controls, and performed an updated @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end evaluating the association between HBV and NHL subtypes. Results: The HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive/anti-HBs-positive population, implying naturally acquired @hit_startimmunity@hit_end after infection, had increased B-NHL risk (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) (95% confidence interval (95% CI)): 2.25 (1.96-2.57)). The HBsAg-positive/HBeAg-positive population, indicating current HBV infection, had high risk of B-NHL (AOR (95% CI): 6.23 (3.95-9.82)). Specifically, for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), there was no significant difference in HBsAg status between the germinal centre B (GCB) and non-GCB subtypes. Additionally, our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end showed in a random effects model, HBV-infected individuals had a pooled OR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.76-2.50; P < 0.01) for NHL. Conclusions: Chronic HBV infection was positively associated with B-NHL in China. However, acquired @hit_startimmunity@hit_end by natural infection also increased B-NHL risk. Thus, we further speculated that regardless of whether HBsAg was cleared, the infected population had higher risk of B-NHL. Our study might expand our knowledge on tumorogenesis of NHL and thus provides clues for novel treatment strategies."

                                "Background: Recent outbreaks and renewed concerns about @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage call for new and effective interventions to improve @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake. Digital technologies have the potential to help address both suboptimal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake and series completion. However, the effectiveness of pushing information and reminders to patients through digital technologies to address @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is not known. Objective(s): The aim of this study is to determine if digital push interventions are effective in increasing @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake and series completion compared to non-digital interventions. Methods: We searched for RCTs where adults or parents of children were eligible for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, the intervention was digital-push and the comparison group was non-digital. We included outcomes of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake or series completion. We estimated summary effect sizes, heterogeneity using the \u03c7@sup_begin2@sup_end test and quantified using the I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic. Where heterogeneity remained significant, we conducted subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. We assessed risk of bias, certainty of evidence and publication bias. Results: The search identified 159 peer-reviewed scientific publications. After review, a total of 12 manuscripts representing 13 empirical studies published between 2012 and 2016 were included. When comparing digital push interventions to non-digital ones, patients had 1.18[1.11,1.25] the odds of receiving @hit_startvaccination@hit_end or series completion compared to controls. In parents of children aged 18 and younger, those receiving digital push had a 1.22[1.15,1.30] increased odds compared to controls. Both @hit_startanalyses@hit_end had high statistical heterogeneity, with I@sup_begin2@sup_end values of 86% and 79% respectively. The risk of bias was low with 10 of 13 studies considered low risk in five or more domains. The certainty of evidence for series completion was very low and for @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake was assessed to be moderate. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that digital push technologies have a modest, positive impact on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake and series completion compared to non-digital interventions."

                                "Introduction: Human papillomavirus (HPV) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end has been proven to effectively protect against HPV infection and infection-associated cancer. However, there are concerns about the relationship between HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and the risk of autoimmune disorders (ADs). Therefore, we performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end to comprehensively evaluate the relationship between HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and ADs risk. Methods: To identify relevant studies, we conducted a systematic search in @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end and @hit_startPubMed@hit_end databases of scientific articles published through June 2018. Fixed or random effects models were adopted to estimate overall relative risk. Results: In total, 20 studies (12 cohort studies, 6 case-control studies, and 2 randomized controlled trials) involving more than 169,000 AD events were included in our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Our results show that HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was not associated with an increased risk of subsequent ADs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.003, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95\u20131.06), particularly among those with a prior ADs (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.7\u20130.96). Most of the subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end results based on the location or type of ADs were consistent with the overall results. Conclusion: No evidence of an association between HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and ADs was found. Given the low number of estimates for individual AD, additional and larger observational studies are needed to verify our findings."

                                "Background: We estimated the relative efficacy and safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) using network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end (NMA) based on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end evaluated two different HZ @hit_startvaccines@hit_end: adjuvanted recombinant zoster @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (RZV) and zoster @hit_startvaccine@hit_end live (ZVL), with different formulations assessed. Detailed feasibility assessment indicated that a NMA was feasible for efficacy (incidence of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia [PHN]) and safety (serious adverse events [SAE] and reactogenicity [injection-site reactions, systemic reaction]) outcomes. Primary @hit_startanalyses@hit_end included frequentist NMAs with fixed effects for efficacy outcomes, due to limited data availability, and both fixed and random effects for safety and reactogenicity outcomes. As age is a known effect modifier of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy (VE), VE @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were stratified by age. Results: RZV demonstrated significantly higher HZ efficacy than ZVL in adults \u226560 years of age (YOA) (VE@sub_beginRZV@sub_end = 0.92 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.88, 0.94), VE@sub_beginZVL@sub_end = 0.51 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.57)) and adults \u226570 YOA (VE@sub_beginRZV@sub_end = 0.91 (95%CI: 0.87, 0.94), VE@sub_beginZVL@sub_end = 0.37 (95%CI: 0.25, 0.48)). Similarly, RZV demonstrated significantly higher PHN efficacy than ZVL in adults \u226560 YOA (VE@sub_beginRZV@sub_end = 0.89 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.96), VE@sub_beginZVL@sub_end = 0.66 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.78)) and adults \u226570 YOA (VE@sub_beginRZV@sub_end = 0.89 (95%CI: 0.69, 0.96), VE@sub_beginZVL@sub_end = 0.67 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.80)). RZV was associated with significantly more injection-site and systemic reactions compared to most formulations of ZVL and placebo, however definitions and data collection procedures differed across the included studies. There were no statistically significant differences found between RZV and any formulation of ZVL or placebo for SAEs. Conclusion: RZV is significantly more effective in reducing HZ and PHN incidence in adults \u226560 YOA, compared with ZVL. As anticipated with an adjuvanted @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, RZV results in more reactogenicity following @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. No differences in SAEs were found between RZV and ZVL."
