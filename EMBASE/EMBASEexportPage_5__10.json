                                "Background: Equity remains a priority in the international health development agenda. However, major inequities in @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage jeopardise the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We aim at comprehensively describing how research has addressed equity issues related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods: We carried out an @hit_startoverview@hit_end of @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end (SRs) that explicitly explored the effects of interventions to improve @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in any context; for any @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and, in any language. We followed standard research synthesis methods to systematically search for SR, assess them for inclusion and extracting relevant data, particularly on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end related outcomes. To gather evidence on equity issues addressed in the SR, we used the PROGRESS-plus framework. Findings: Our search obtained 2,003 hits which resulted in 54 included SRs, published between 1994 and 2014. The quality of SRs was generally poor, with less than half complying with most of the quality criteria. Reported @hit_startvaccines@hit_end included, by order of frequency, influenza and Expanded Programme on @hit_startImmunisation vaccines@hit_end. The types of interventions more frequently reported were related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end delivery strategies, financial support and information, education and communication. Most of the SRs suggested effects favouring intervention groups as opposed to comparison groups. The most frequently reported equity attribute was \u2018place of residence\u2019 and the least reported equity attributes were sexual orientation and religion. Very few estimates of effects actually measured differences or changes between groups having those attributes and all of them referred to the place of residence. No data was found about reducing equity gaps for vulnerable groups or minorities, or attributes such as sexual orientation, education or specific religious groups. Conclusions: Although research on vulnerable populations as a subgroup is abundant, it fails to report on the interventions that will actually reduce inequities and consider how redistribution of health care resources could shrink the gap between the privileged and most vulnerable groups including minorities. Research, if aiming at being responsive to global health policy trends, needs to report not only on specific attributes but also on how a better redistribution of health care resources could contribute to alleviating the unjust situation of the most vulnerable populations."

                                "RESULTS: Current @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedules in developed countries provide prophylaxis for tetanus. However, when severe natural disasters occur, many patients may not be able to provide a reliable @hit_startvaccination@hit_end history. In these situations, tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is indicated; if resources are not limited, both tetanus toxoid and TIG should be given to those with high-risk wounds. If resources are limited, TIG should be reserved for those that would benefit most or those least likely to have the protective antibodies.",
                                "CONCLUSIONS: Although tetanus is a disease that has a low incidence in the developed world due to high rates of @hit_startimmunization@hit_end, during large-scale natural disasters, compounding factors like the types of injuries, lack of medical services and supplies, and the delay in treatment associated with an already low @hit_startimmunization@hit_end rate result in an increased incidence and outbreaks of the disease that has higher mortality in an underdeveloped society. It is important for the urban physician that cares for trauma and critical patients to become familiar with the protocols for treatment and @hit_startimmunization@hit_end of patients that have tetanus-prone wounds, as well as recognize the potential for outbreaks in the settings of major natural disasters.

Where appropriate and feasible, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end information should be targeted to address beliefs about ethnic differences held by some individuals from some BAME backgrounds.",
                                "BACKGROUND: Uptake of some childhood immunisations in the UK is lower among those from some Black and Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of qualitative research sought to understand the factors that are associated with ethnicity that influence the @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end decisions of parents from BAME backgrounds living in the UK.",
                                "METHODS: Databases were searched on 2 December 2014 for studies published at any time using the terms 'UK' and '@hit_startvaccination@hit_end' and 'qualitative methods' (and variations of these). Included articles comprised participants who were parents from BAME backgrounds. Thematic synthesis methods were used to develop descriptive and higher order themes. Themes specific to ethnicity and associated factors are reported.",
                                "RESULTS: Eight papers were included in the review. Most participants were from Black (n=62) or Asian (n=38) backgrounds. Two ethnicity-related factors affected @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end decisions. First, factors that are related to ethnicity itself (namely religion, upbringing and migration, and language) affected parents' perceived importance of immunisations, whether immunisations were permitted or culturally acceptable and their understanding of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end/the @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end schedule. Second, perceived biological differences affected decision-making and demand for information."

                                "Background: One of the most effective strategies to prevent infections is @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, especially in patients treated with biologics and immunosuppressive (IS) agents. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the resulting immune response in these patients has been questioned. Objectives: To perform a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end aiming to assess evidence available regarding immune response efficiency (IRE) and the ideal schedule for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in RA and SpA patients treated with Methotrexate (MTX), TNF inhibitors (TNFi), anti-CD20 (rituximab, RTX), anti-CTLA4 (abatacept, ABA) or anti-IL6 (tocilizumab, TCZ). Methods: A @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end was conducted by searching in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end all studies with the MeSH terms \u201c[Rheumato\u00efd Arthritis\u201d OR \u201cSpondyloarthritis\u201d] AND [\u201c@hit_startvaccination@hit_end\u201d OR \u201c@hit_startvaccines@hit_end\u201d] AND [\u201cMethotrexate\u201d OR \u201cAbatacept\u201d OR \u201cTocilizumab\u201d OR \u201cRituximab\u201d OR \u201cAdalimumab\u201d OR \u201cCertolizumab\u201d OR \u201cEtanercept\u201d OR \u201cGolimumab\u201d OR \u201cInfliximab\u201d], with no limitation regarding time of publication. Only studies evaluating the IRE were included. Case reports, general reviews and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end were excluded. Results: After exclusion criteria, 35 studies (out of 60 studies retrieved) assessing IRE in RA or SpA patients were selected, under MTX (n=35), TNFi (n=18), RTX (n=8), ABA (n=4) or TCZ (n=5). The studied @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were mostly the trivalent seasonal Influenza (n=20), the anti-pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (n=16), and few studies regarding the tetanus toxoid @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (TTV) (n=2), Hepatitis A @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (n=1) and accidental revaccination against yellow fever (n=2). Most studies (32/35) evaluated the IRE using the antibody (Ab) titer. When studying the anti-pneumococcal and influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, the primary outcome was mainly the seroresponse 3 to 6 weeks after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (i.e. Ab ratio post/pre-@hit_startvaccine@hit_end) but some studies (15/35) also assessed the seroprotection rate (i.e. patients with an effective titer of protective Ab), and some (3/35) the effectiveness of seroresponse using the opsonization index rate. Regarding the anti-pneumococcal and influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, MTX, RTX, and ABA were reported to impair the immune response; neither TNFi nor TCZ were shown to decrease seroresponse. Regarding TTV, one study showed persistent seroresponse in patients treated with TNFi; a second study showed no difference between MTX and RTX in response to T-cell dependant protein Ag TTV. Two studies reported no significant difference in efficiency or tolerance in patients accidentally revaccinated against yellow fever under TNFi. Conclusions: These observations highly suggest that an effective @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for patients treated with MTX, RTX, and ABA should necessitate a therapeutic window or a scheduled treatment spacing, in order to offer the best protection against Influenza and Pneumococcal infection. This might not be necessary in patients under TNFi or TCZ; nevertheless, further studies are necessary to optimize the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end modalities."

Methods: We electronically searched databases including CNKI, VIP information resource integration service platform, WanFang Data, CBM, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, to collect studies on Chinese people who had received full rabies @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and recording all the adverse reactions, from January 2000 to July 2016. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were strictly followed. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end for the adverse reaction rate was performed using the R software. Results: A total of 29 related papers had met the inclusion criteria, with no publication bias noticed. A total number of 11 020 cases had adverse reactions, among all the 94 222 respondents, with an incidence of adverse reactions as 1.04%-47.78%. The overall incidence rate of adverse reaction was 9.82% (95%CI: 7.58%-12.72%), A combined local adverse reaction rate appeared as 12.05% (95%C/: 9.26%-15.69%). The systemic adverse reaction rate was 9.06% (95%CI: 7.07%-11.61%). The overall adverse reaction rate on aqueous @hit_startvaccine@hit_end was 32.39% (95% CI: 21.88%-47.94%). Combined adverse reaction rate of freeze dried @hit_startvaccine@hit_end appeared as 8.65% (95%CI: 4.54%-16.51%). Significant differences were seen between both groups (P<0.05). Conclusions: The local adverse reaction rate caused by rabies @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was higher than the systemic adverse reaction rate. The adverse reaction rate of aqueous rabies @hit_startvaccine@hit_end was higher than that of freeze dried rabies @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Our results suggested that the aqueous @hit_startvaccine@hit_end should gradually be eliminated."

                                "One reason for doing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is that experiments can be convincing. Early epidemiological experimenters, such as Jenner and the smallpox @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and Snow and his famous Broad Street pump handle, already knew the answer they were demonstrating; they used the experiments as knowledge translation devices to convince others.More sophisticated modern experiments include cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCTs) for experiments in the public health setting. The knowledge translation value remains: RCTs and CRCTs can potentially stimulate changes of practice among stakeholders. Capitalising on the knowledge translation value of RCTs requires more than the standard reporting of trials. Those who are convinced by a trial and want to act, need to know how the trial relates to their own context, what contributed to success, and what might make it even more effective. Implementation research unpacks the back-story, examining how and why an intervention worked.The Camino Verde trial of community mobilisation for control of dengue reported a significant impact on entomological indices of the Aedes aegypti vector, and on serological dengue virus infection and self-reported dengue cases. This important study should lead to studies of similar interventions in other contexts, and ultimately to changes in dengue control practices. This supplement is the back-story of the trial, providing information to help researchers and planners to make use of the trial findings.Background articles include the full protocol, a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of CRCTs of approaches for Aedes aegypti control, epidemiological and entomological findings from the baseline survey, and how baseline findings were used to set up the intervention. Secondary @hit_startanalyses@hit_end of the entomological findings examine associations with the use of the larvicide temephos, and the impact of the intervention in different conditions of water supply and seasons.Other articles describe implementation and other impacts: the underlying approach; implementation in the trial's different social contexts; the different impact in women and men; the effects of using fish for vector control; the impact on household costs of personal protection and of cases of dengue illness; and ethical issues.We hope this supplement will increase the knowledge translation value of the Camino Verde trial."

Simultaneously, TDEs have been shown to be potent anticancer @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and drug delivery vehicles for cancer treatment. The objective of this study was to summarize the current status of tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) in tumor diagnosis and therapy at home and abroad. METHODS Application of @hit_startPubmed@hit_end and CNKI periodical full-text database retrieval system were searched with \"exosomes, tumors, biomarkers and therapy\" as keywords, from 2006 to 2016, and 569 English literatures and 79 Chinese literatures were got. Including criteria:The biological function of TDEs; The application of TDEs as tumor biomarkers; The studies of TDEs as therapeutic target. A total of fifty-four literatures were include.RESULTS TDEs, as communication vehicles between cells, have biological functions of regulating tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. TDEs are rich in tumor marker molecules, and TDEs and their modified products can be used as a cell free @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and drug delivery vehicle for the treatment of cancer.CONCLUSION TDEs can be used as ideal targets for tumor diagnosis and treatment, but there are still many problems to be solved in clinical application."

                                "Background: Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy plays a key role in patients with bladder cancer. The shortage of intravesical BCG has motivated researchers to seek alternatives with equivalent efficacy If other alternative intravesical agents have equivalent efficacy compared to BCG, then it may be feasible to replace standard BCG with alternative options. Methods: We searched all relevant evidence in multiple sources and key data was extracted from included studies. Conventional and network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end were conducted so that pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the event of tumor recurrence and progression can be computed. The relative efficacy of different intravesical instillation procedures was computed by pooled odds ratios and their 95% confidence or creditable intervals. Besides, several key model assumptions were evaluated in our @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Results: Three intravesical instillation procedures have the potential for preventing tumor recurrence: Standard-dose BCG (BCG-SD), Epirubicin (EPI) and Mitomycin C (MMC) (ORs < 1). Patients with BCG SD also exhibited a decreased risk of tumor recurrence and progression compared to those with EPI. No significant difference in the risk of tumor recurrence or progression was detected between patients treated with BCG- SD and those with low-dose BCG (BCG-LD). Results of SUCRA indicated that BCG-EPI, BCG- MMC and BCG SD had higher rankings with respect to tumor recurrence and progression. Conclusions: BCG SD, EPI and MMC exhibited established efficacy for preventing tumor recurrence in postoperative BC patients. The efficacy of BCG may not be significantly reduced if standard dose was reduced to a lower level. However, there is no consensus suggesting that intravesical BCG with standard dose can be replaced by alternating or sequentially combined intravesical instillation therapies."

                                "Pharmacovigilance is the activity related with the detection, evaluation, understanding and prevention of adverse events, adverse reactions or the suspection of these, of events supposedly attributable to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end or @hit_startimmunization@hit_end; or any other safety problem related with the use of drugs and @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. The aim of this study is to present a review on the pharmacovigilance work carried out in Mexico and the current problems it faces. In this regard, a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was carried out in bibliographic databases (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end/@hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, Science), a documentary @hit_startanalysis@hit_end in public magazines and documented information by the World Health Organization, the Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) and the National Pharmacovigilance Centre (CNFV). In Mexico, Pharmacovigilance starts at the end of the 1980s, and in 1995 is when the National Pharmacovigilance Centre was created after 68 events of suspected adverse drug reaction were reported. Almost a decade after, Pharmacovigilance acquires greater interest due to outreach and education campaigns, resulting in an increase in notifications received in the National Pharmacovigilance Centre in 2005 with 7 950 reports of suspected adverse reactions, and by 2013 were received 35 386 reports. Nowadays, the main challenge is the improvement in the quality of information in these reports. In the last year, 49.3 % of the reports were grade 2 and 0.67 % were grade 3. Notifications with insufficient information are of little use to set a precedent of it or give proper follow up to an adverse reaction to a drug. Results shown that the tasks of promoting Pharmacovigilance in the country have been successful; however, there is a need to work on refining the documentation of the whole process."
