                                "Introduction: The prevalence of group A streptococcal (GAS) disease is estimated at >18.1 million cases with an incidence of >1.78 million cases py. While GAS is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity on the global scale, the burden of GAS disease in Africa is not known. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in a number of databases, using an African search filter to identify published studies of GAS prevalence amongst symptomatic patients. Two reviewers independently selected articles meeting pre-specified criteria and extracted data on a standardised data extraction form. Statistical @hit_startanalysis@hit_end included the identification of data sources, documenting estimates, and the application of the random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end model to aggregate prevalence estimates 95% CI for GAS. We applied Freeman-Tukey transformation to account for between study variability. The I2 statistic was used to determine the extent of variation in effect estimates due to heterogeneity (H0). Results: Of 128 articles identified, 27 met the inclusion criteria. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end revealed a pooled prevalence of 23% (95% CI, 20-27%). Regional pooled prevalences were similar between Western, 25% (95% CI, 23-27%) and Northern Africa, 26% (95% CI, 21-31%). Central and Eastern Africa had the lowest pooled estimate of 5% (95% CI, 2-11%) and 16% (95% CI, 8-27%) respectively, while Southern Africa had the highest pooled estimate of 32% (95% CI, 20- 46%). Two articles reported on molecular characterisation of isolates with 92 emm-types documented; the most dominant subtypes were emm44, 48 and 65. Conclusion: The prevalence of GAS is high in Africa. Efforts focused on the primary prevention of GAS pharyngitis are therefore warranted. Data on molecular strain characterization of GAS in Africa is largely non-existent and thus there is a need for further studies such as AFROStrep to inform current prevention efforts including @hit_startvaccine@hit_end development."

                                "Background: Currently, a dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end has been approved in some countries. The problem with this new @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is whether the public could accept and be willing to purchase. Objectives: This study aimed to provide solid data regarding factors associated with acceptance and willingness to pay for dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end with a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted on September-October 2016 for previous studies. Literatures from @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end were searched for eligible publications (cut-off date for updates: September 10, 2016). The combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were assessed using random or fixed effect model. Narrative review was used to @hit_startanalyze@hit_end the data when they were not qualified for @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Results: There were several factors associated with acceptance of dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end including attitude toward @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, preventive measures against dengue, attitude towards dengue, knowledge on dengue, socioeconomic level, and dengue experience. However, our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end revealed that only attitude towards @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (OR95%CI = 0.313 [0.137 - 0.713], P = 0.006) and socioeconomic level (OR95%CI = 0.576 [0.385 - 0.862], P = 0.007) had significant associations with dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end acceptance. Studies also revealed that preventive measures against dengue, attitude towards dengue, knowledge on dengue fever, knowledge on dengue viruses, socioeconomic levels, dengue experience, and @hit_startvaccine@hit_end price were associated with willingness to pay. However, none of those data was qualified for @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Conclusions: @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end reveals that good attitude towards @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and higher socioeconomic levels are associated with better acceptance of dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end."

                                "BACKGROUND: Numbers of looked-after children and young people (LACYP) in the UK have risen over the last seven years. Looked-after children and young people should receive regular health assessments, including establishing @hit_startimmunization@hit_end status and, if needed, developing a health plan to achieve full @hit_startimmunization@hit_end. The Department for Education publish data on immunizations among LACYP to monitor both how well they are @hit_startimmunized@hit_end and service performance.",
                                "METHODS: A @hit_startliterature review@hit_end was conducted using four databases (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, Scopus and Web of Science) on @hit_startimmunization@hit_end status of LACYP, factors affecting uptake and challenges to @hit_startimmunization@hit_end, and interventions to improve @hit_startimmunization@hit_end rates.",
                                "RESULTS: Thirty-two papers were identified, 16 of which were UK based. Looked-after children and young people are less likely to be 'up-to-date' with their immunizations than children in the general population. Looked-after children and young people are less likely to receive timely immunizations, and older LACYP are less likely to be 'up-to-date' than younger LACYP. Barriers to @hit_startimmunization@hit_end include failure to attend health checks, absence from school and frequent placement moves. Unknown and discrepant @hit_startimmunization@hit_end histories, name changes, sharing of information between organizations and obtaining consent for immunizations are also challenges.",
                                "CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, @hit_startimmunization@hit_end of LACYP has been given a higher priority. However, the @hit_startimmunization@hit_end figures produced by the Department for Education are problematic because of challenges in determining whether the child is 'up-to-date', and data are not comparable with the general population; ideally, this should be changed to correspond to routine @hit_startimmunization@hit_end data. In the interim, for reporting purposes, the use of a tool to assist with determining a child's @hit_startimmunization@hit_end status would be beneficial. When a child's @hit_startimmunization@hit_end status is incomplete or unknown, Public Health England's algorithm for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of individuals with uncertain or incomplete status should be used. Practice to improve @hit_startimmunization@hit_end uptake amongst LACYP needs to be evaluated to develop evidence-based recommendations."

                                "DESIGN AND METHODS: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of three databases was performed. Studies conducted in high-income countries and published from 2000 onward that addressed influences on PA and sedentary behaviors of preschool-age children were identified and reviewed. Additionally, reference lists of identified articles and relevant published reviews were reviewed. Studies that met the following inclusion criteria were considered: (a) sample included preschoolers (age \u22645 years); (b) PA and/or sedentary behaviors or factors associated with PA and/or sedentary behaviors was assessed; (c) published in English; (d) used either quantitative or qualitative methods; and (e) conducted in a high-income country. Data were extracted from selected studies to identify influences on PA and sedentary behaviors of preschool-age children and organized using the social-ecological model according to multiple levels of influence.",
                                "PURPOSE: Promoting physical activity (PA) is a key component of preventing and controlling childhood obesity. Despite well-documented benefits of PA, globally, rates of PA among young children have declined over the past decades, and most children are not accruing sufficient PA daily. Helping children develop the foundation for PA habits early in life is critical for the promotion of health in childhood and prevention of chronic diseases later in life, and will ultimately promote longer and healthier lives for individuals and the general population. The purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of current evidence on influences on PA and sedentary behaviors of preschool-age children in high-income countries.",
                                "RESULTS: Results from included studies identify multiple factors that influence PA and sedentary behaviors of young children in high-income countries at the various levels of the social-ecological model including intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental, organizational, and policy.",
                                "PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Given pediatric nurses' role as primary care providers, and their frequent and continued contact with parents and their children throughout childhood through well-child visits, @hit_startimmunization@hit_end, and minor acute illnesses, they are well positioned to promote and support the development of early healthful PA habits of children starting in early childhood."

                                "There is a worryingly large chasm between scientific consensus and popular opinion. Roughly one third of Americans are skeptical that humans are primarily responsible for climate change; rates of some infectious diseases are climbing in the face of anti-@hit_startimmunization@hit_end beliefs; and significant numbers of the population worldwide are antievolution creationists. It is easy to assume that resistance to an evidence-based message is a result of ignorance or failure to grasp evidence (the \"deficit model\" of science communication). But increasingly, theorists understand there are limits to this approach, and that if people are motivated to reject science, then repeating evidence will have little impact. In an effort to create a transtheoretical language for describing these underlying motivations, we introduce the notion of \"attitude roots.\" Attitude roots are the underlying fears, ideologies, worldviews, and identity needs that sustain and motivate specific \"surface\" attitudes like climate skepticism and creationism. It is the antiscience attitude that people hear and see, but it is the attitude root-what lies under the surface-that allows the surface attitudes to survive even when they are challenged by evidence. We group these attitude roots within 6 themes-worldviews, conspiratorial ideation, vested interests, personal identity expression, social identity needs, and fears and phobias-and @hit_startreview literature@hit_end relevant to them. We then use these insights to develop a \"jiu jitsu\" model of persuasion that places emphasis on creating change by aligning with (rather than competing with) these attitude roots.

                                "Introduction We conducted two @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end. Review 1 (R1) summarised evidence for the influence of HIV on HPV acquisition and clearance. Review 2 (R2) summarised the evidence for the influence of HPV on HIV acquisition. R1 is the first @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analytic@hit_end review to quantify the impact of HIV on HPV infection. R2 updates two earlier @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end. Methods Both reviews were conducted according to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end up to January 2017 for longitudinal studies of HPV incidence and clearance rate by HIV status and of HIV incidence by HPV status. We derived pooled relative risk (RR) estimates using a random effect model and performed subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end to understand main sources of heterogeneity, examined doseresponse relationship and produced funnel plots. Results In R1, 37 publications comprising 25 independent study populations were included. The incidence of HPV (pooled crude RR [cRR]=1.55, 95% CI 1.29-1.88) and of high-risk (HR) HPV (pooled cRR=2.20, 95% CI 1.90-2.54) was doubled whereas HPV clearance rate (pooled cRR=0.53, 95% CI 0.42-0.67) and HR-HPV clearance (pooled cRR=0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83) was nearly halved among people living with HIV (PLHIV). HPV incidence when CD4 count \u2264200 cells/mL among PLHIV was higher, but not statistically significant, than for CD4 >200 cells/mL (pooled cRR=6.65, 95% CI 2.98-14.85 vs 3.20, 95% CI 2.48-4.13). In R2, 14 publications comprising 11 independent study populations were included. HIV incidence was almost doubled in the presence of prevalent HPV infection (pooled cRR=1.91, 95% CI 1.38-2.65) and for HR-HPV (pooled cRR=1.63, 95% CI 1.26-2.09). Risk of HIV acquisition increased with the number of HPV types. Crude and adjusted pooled estimates were similar in both reviews. There was more evidence of publication bias in R2 than R1. Conclusions The findings met most Bradford-Hill criteria for causation. Our results have clinical and public health relevance: HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end may benefit PLHIV and indirectly help to reduce HIV transmission. HIV prevention may also reduce HPV transmission."

                                "Introduction HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections cause a large burden of disease globally and are correlated epidemiologically through shared risk factors. There is also evidence for direct, biological interactions, with HSV-2 infection increasing HIV susceptibility (and vice versa). We update and expand on two previous @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end of the association between HSV-2 infection and HIV acquisition published over a decade ago. Methods We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of 56 longitudinal studies of the association between HSV-2 infection and HIV acquisition. We calculated pooled effect sizes using DerSimonian-Laird inverse-variance methods for the association between existing (prevalent) HSV- 2 infection and HIV seroconversion and the first-ever pooled effect sizes for new (incident) HSV-2 infection on HIV. We extended previous evaluations through detailed @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression and sub-group @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Results The risk of acquiring HIV infection was approximately doubled in the presence of prevalent HSV-2 infection, and higher among general populations (aRR=2.7; 95% CI 2.2-3.4, n=24) than higher-risk populations such as commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men (aRR=1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.1, n=25). Incident HSV-2 infection was associated with the highest risk of acquiring HIV: up to aRR=4.7 (95%CI 2.2-10.1, n=6). Adjustment for confounders was often incomplete, but this did not meaningfully influence results in subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Substantial heterogeneity across study estimates was explained by risk group, timing of HSV-2 infection, and world region. Conclusion There is good evidence for a direct effect of HSV- 2 infection on HIV acquisition risk. This has important implications for managing individuals diagnosed with genital herpes, given the greater risk of acquiring HIV, especially for those newly infected. Interventions targeted against HSV-2, such as new HSV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, have the potential for an additional benefit against HIV, which could be substantial particularly in regions where co-infections are abundant."

                                "Objective: Since eliminating hepatitis B in China would need considerable public health resources, the economics problem of the strategy of community-based antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has become an important issue. The cost-effectiveness and affordability of the strategy were evaluated in this study. Methods: According to the advocacy on eliminating hepatitis B by WHO and the comprehensive protocol of community based prevention of major infectious diseases and the guideline for CHB prevention and treatment in China, the decision @hit_startanalytic@hit_end Markov model was constructed with the parameters from national surveys or @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. A cohort population aged 20-59 years was used as study subjects. The strategy of CHB antiviral treatment was compared with the strategies of hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and non-intervention, respectively. The costs and disability-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the strategies were calculated from the societal and payer perspectives. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) were calculated for the comparison of the strategies. One-way and probability sensitivity @hit_startanalysis@hit_end were performed for uncertainty of the results. And the cost-effectiveness and affordability curves were introduced to estimate the budget impact on the strategies. Results: In the Chinese aged 20-59 years, the ICER of CHB antiviral treatment was 37 598.6 yuan (RMB) per QALYs and the ICERs were smaller in the low age groups, indicating that the antiviral treatment strategy is cost-effective and low age groups should be the priority population. The ICER of hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was -64 000.0 yuan (RMB) per QALYs, indicating that hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is cost saving. The CER of CHB antiviral treatment ranged from 731.8 to 1 813.3 yuan (RMB) per QALYs compared with hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, and the CER of CHB antiviral treatment was higher than that of hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in all age groups, indicating that hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end would be more cost-effective than CHB antiviral treatment. The price of antiviral drug, entercavir, can influence the cost effectiveness of CHB antiviral treatment. If the price of entercavir declined half, CHB antiviral treatment would be cost-saving. The probability sensitivity @hit_startanalysis@hit_end showed that people's willing to pay for CHB antiviral treatment should not be ignored, although the results of economics evaluation of CHB antiviral treatment were reliable. The results of affordability @hit_startanalysis@hit_end indicated that the antiviral treatment strategy could not be implemented with the budget lower than 30 million yuan (RMB), the probability of implementing the strategy was 42.6% if the budget reaches 127 million yuan (RMB), and only when the budget reaches 269 million yuan (RMB), the goal of CHB antiviral treatment strategy can be fully realized. Conclusions: Although the strategy of CHB antiviral treatment as prevention in Chinese aged 20-59 years is cost-effective, it is not an appropriate public health measure due to the high cost. The cost effectiveness would be higher by conducting hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and then antiviral treatment in susceptible population."

                                "This study was a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of the literature on the efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in preventing vertical transmission of hepatitis B in pregnancies with high viral load. Four observational studies and one randomized controlled trial involving 585 pregnant women and 595 newborns were included in the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. TDF was more effective than the placebo in reducing vertical transmission in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) pregnancies with high serum HBV-DNA levels (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.07-0.61) at 4-12 months, infant HBV DNA seropositivity at delivery (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.07-0.37), and a severe flair in maternal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.95) during pregnancy. In addition, TDF showed more improvement in HBV DNA suppression at delivery (OR = 254.46, 95% CI = 28.39-2280.79). No significant differences were found in HBeAg seroconversion or ALT normalization; or in rates of cesarean section, emergent cesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, prematurity, congenital malformations, or infant death. However, TDF induced more drug-related adverse events (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.39-3.89) and elevated creatine kinase (CK) (OR = 9.56, 95% CI = 1.17-78.09) than in controls. The available evidence suggests that TDF is effective and safe in preventing vertical transmission of hepatitis B in pregnancies exhibiting a high viral load."

                                "This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and cumulative @hit_startanalysis@hit_end aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination of intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) plus bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients. A comprehensive literature search using @hit_startPubmed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, CBM, CNKI and VIP databases was performed to identify studies applying intravesical MMC plus BCG therapy on NMIBC patients up to June 2016. Summarized unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy. A total of 25 studies containing 2749 NMIBC patients were included in this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end. Compared with BCG monotherapy, the combination therapy could significantly reduce the tumor recurrence rate (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44-0.94, P = 0.02) and cancer-specific mortality (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.87, P = 0.01), without more toxicities (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.17-1.94, P = 0.37). The combination therapy could also lead to significant lower tumor recurrence rate than MMC monotherapy (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.24-0.69, P = 0.0009). Our study indicates that the combination of MMC plus BCG instillation is an effective and safe adjuvant treatment for NMIBC patients."
