                                "Introduction Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PCV7) was first introduced in 2000 in US and at various times in other countries. It was replaced by 13-valent pneu-mococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (PCV13) in 2010. This PCV are highly effective in preventing IPD in children with SCD. The risk of IPD has not been systematically assessed in children with SCD since the introduction of PCV. Methods We undertook a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the English literature published from 2000 to October 2017 to evaluate the risk factors, serotype distribution, clinical presentation and outcomes of IPD in children with sickle cell disease. Data sources included @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE Cochrane@hit_end library, and REFERENCES within identified articles. Results We identified 475 potential studies, of which 66 were duplicates. A further 299 were excluded on the basis of title and abstracts and another 94 studies did not meet eligibility criteria on full-text screening. We included 16 publications involving 11 383 children less than 21 years-olds with SCD. A total of 161 (1.4%) IPD was identified: 147 homozygote for haemoglobin S (HbSS), 10 double heterozygote for haemoglobin S and C (HbSC) and 4 others. Among the nine studies reporting clinical presentation, septicaemia was the commonest (n=69/108; 63.8%) followed by pneumonia (n=20/108; 18.5%). The serotypes associated with IPD in SCD were mainly non-PCV13 (n=117/133; 88%), of which more than a quarter was due to serogroup 15A/B/C (n=34/117; 29%,). Serotype 23 F (n=6/16, 37.5%) and 7 F (n=4/16; 25%) were the main @hit_startvaccine@hit_end serotypes. Majority were sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The crude case fatality rate was 11.2% (n=18/161). Conclusions and clinical implications This report demonstrates the effectiveness of conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to reduce the rate of IPD in children with SCD. However, these children remain at increased risk and are also more likely to die of their infection compared to their peers without SCD. Most IPD cases are now due to serotypes not covered by PCV13. Therefore better prevention strategies are needed to reduce the overall burden IPD in children with SCD."

                                "Background We aimed to estimate, for the first time, the global burden of Group B Streptococcus (GBS), with regards to invasive disease in infants, as well as in pregnant and post-partum women, and fetal infection/stillbirth. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is currently used for prevention of early onset infant disease in high-income contexts, but is difficult to implement globally, and may contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Maternal GBS @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are in development. Methods For 2015 live births, we used data from @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end (presented in separate papers in this GBS supplement) and a compartmental model to estimate:. exposure to maternal GBS colonisation,. cases of infant invasive GBS disease,. deaths, and. disabilities. We applied incidence or prevalence data to estimate cases of maternal and fetal infection/stillbirth, and infants with invasive GBS disease presenting with neonatal encephalopathy (NE). We applied risk ratios to estimate numbers of preterm births attributable to GBS. Uncertainty was also estimated. Worldwide in 2015, we estimated 2 05 000 (uncertainty range [UR], 101000-327000) infants with early-onset disease and 1 14 000 (UR, 44000-326000) with late-onset disease, of whom a minimum of 7000 (UR, 0-19000) presented with neonatal encephalopathy. There were 90 000 (UR, 36000-169000) deaths in infants<3 months age, and, at least 10 000 (UR, 3000-27000) children with disability each year. There were 33 000 (UR, 13000-52000) cases of invasive GBS disease in pregnant or postpartum women, and 57 000 (UR, 12000-104000) fetal infections/stillbirths. Up to 3.5 million preterm births may be attributable to GBS. Africa accounted for 54% of estimated cases and 65% of all fetal/infant deaths. A maternal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end with 80% efficacy and 90% coverage could prevent 1 07 000 (UR, 20000-198000) stillbirths and infant deaths. Conclusions Our conservative estimates suggest that GBS is a leading contributor to adverse maternal and newborn outcomes, with at least 4 09 000 (UR, 144000-573000) mater-nal/fetal/infant cases and 1 47 000 (UR, 47000-273000) stillbirths and infant deaths annually. An effective GBS @hit_startvaccine@hit_end could reduce disease in the mother, the fetus, and the infant."

                                "Introduction Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PCV7) was first introduced in 2000 in US and at various times in other countries. It was replaced by 13-valent pneu-mococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (PCV13) in 2010. This PCV are highly effective in preventing IPD in children with SCD. The risk of IPD has not been systematically assessed in children with SCD since the introduction of PCV. Methods We undertook a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the English literature published from 2000 to October 2017 to evaluate the risk factors, serotype distribution, clinical presentation and outcomes of IPD in children with sickle cell disease. Data sources included @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE Cochrane@hit_end library, and REFERENCES within identified articles. Results We identified 475 potential studies, of which 66 were duplicates. A further 299 were excluded on the basis of title and abstracts and another 94 studies did not meet eligibility criteria on full-text screening. We included 16 publications involving 11 383 children less than 21 years-olds with SCD. A total of 161 (1.4%) IPD was identified: 147 homozygote for haemoglobin S (HbSS), 10 double heterozygote for haemoglobin S and C (HbSC) and 4 others. Among the nine studies reporting clinical presentation, septicaemia was the commonest (n=69/108; 63.8%) followed by pneumonia (n=20/108; 18.5%). The serotypes associated with IPD in SCD were mainly non-PCV13 (n=117/133; 88%), of which more than a quarter was due to serogroup 15A/B/C (n=34/117; 29%,). Serotype 23 F (n=6/16, 37.5%) and 7 F (n=4/16; 25%) were the main @hit_startvaccine@hit_end serotypes. Majority were sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The crude case fatality rate was 11.2% (n=18/161). Conclusions and clinical implications This report demonstrates the effectiveness of conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to reduce the rate of IPD in children with SCD. However, these children remain at increased risk and are also more likely to die of their infection compared to their peers without SCD. Most IPD cases are now due to serotypes not covered by PCV13. Therefore better prevention strategies are needed to reduce the overall burden IPD in children with SCD."

                                "Introduction & Objectives: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) pose a major burden of disease worldwide. High prevalence and recurrence rates, coupled with increasing antimicrobial resistance, have highlighted the need for a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. We assessed current @hit_startvaccine@hit_end candidates primarily according to clinical efficacy in reducing UTI recurrence rate. Materials & Methods: @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and reference lists of relevant reviews were searched up to August 2017 for relevant English-titled citations. Randomised controlled trials were selected by two independent reviewers according to compliance with population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO) criteria; @hit_startvaccine@hit_end versus placebo for the reduction of UTI recurrence in adult patients experiencing recurrent UTIs. Differences in recurrence rates in study populations for individual trials were calculated and pooled, and risk ratios using random effects models were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed using the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Collaboration's tool and heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-squared and I2 testing. Results: 598 records were identified, of which 10 studies including data for a total of 1668 patients were selected. 3 @hit_startvaccine@hit_end candidates were studied: Uro-Vaxom (6), Urovac (3), and ExPEC4V (1). Uro-Vaxom showed greatest reduction in UTI recurrence rate; the maximal effect was seen at 3 months compared with 6 months after initial treatment (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.57-0.78 and RR 0.78 95% CI 0.69-0.88). Urovac showed an effect at 20 weeks comparable to that of Uro-Vaxom at 3 months (RR 0.68 95% CI 0.56-0.83). ExPEC4V achieved reduction in E.coli UTI recurrence but this was not statistically significant (RR 0.75 95% CI 0.52-1.08) and was ineffective against UTIs caused by other uropathogens (RR 1.00 95% CI 0.55-1.80). Overall, UTI @hit_startvaccines@hit_end reduced recurrence compared to placebo (RR 0.72 95% CI 0.66-0.80), albeit substantial heterogeneity was Conclusions: While there is some evidence for the efficacy in @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in patients with recurrent UTIs, the significant heterogeneity amongst these studies renders interpretation and recommendation for routine clinical use difficult at present. Further randomized trials using consistent definitions and end-points are needed to study the long-term efficacy and safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for preventing infections in patients with recurrent UTIs.

                                "Background: Stillbirth has long-lasting psychosocial impacts for families and health services, one focus of impact is a subsequent pregnancy. The majority of parents will conceive again following stillbirth, and in these pregnancies parents face an increased risk of stillbirth and other adverse outcomes, and many experience profound anxiety and stress. Despite the need, there is currently little evidence to guide clinical practice. Methods: A @hit_startCochrane systematic review@hit_end of RCTs was conducted to assess the effects of different interventions or models of care prior to and during subsequent pregnancies following stillbirth on maternal, fetal, neonatal and family health outcomes, and health service utilisation. Parents with a history of stillbirth of 20 weeks gestation or more, who are pregnant or considering a subsequent pregnancy, were included. Results: Nine trials were identified, assessing the use of (or combinations of the use of) lose-dose aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, intravenous immunoglobulin, third-party leukocyte @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end, and progesterone therapy. The trials randomised 34 to 449 women, of which 6 to 45 were eligible for inclusion in our review. We found no differences among the primary outcomes (stillbirth; neonatal death; adverse perinatal outcome; adverse maternal psychological effects) across the interventions, though the number of studies and number of women included in each comparison was small Conclusions: Based on these findings, there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice for care in pregnancies following stillbirth. Large-scale RCTs are needed to assess the effectiveness of specific interventions for reducing the risk of stillbirth recurrence and improving other outcomes."

                                "Introduction: Recurrent urinary tract infection is frequent and it is related to morbidity, costs and growing antibiotic resistance. OM 8930 @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is composed by Escherichia coli polysaccharide and it is a possible prophylactic measure, but there is doubt as to its effectiveness. Material and Methods: We performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end in evidence-based medicine databases with rigorous bibliography selection. Results: We found an effective decrease of recurrences in test groups. Discussion: We recommend the administration of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end as prophylaxis of recurrent cystitis. Conclusion: The @hit_startvaccine@hit_end has impact on the recurrent cystitis relapse rate. We suggest that more studies be carried out to evaluate the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end cost-benefit and its effectiveness in complicated urinary infections."

                                "Background: Infuenza infection is associated with increased risk for mortality and hospitalization in heart failure patients. Although the prognostic beneft of infuenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in heart failure patients has been examined in several studies, the results are inconsistent due partly to small sample sizes. We aimed to conduct a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of the effect of infuenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on mortality and hospitalization in heart failure patients. Methods: The search of electronic databases identifed 5 observational cohort studies (78,882 patients; mean age, 64-75 years; men, 39%-79%; follow-up duration, 1-4 years) but no randomized controlled trials on the effect of infuenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end on mortality or hospitalization in heart failure patients. Results: Pooled @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of confounder-adjusted hazard ratio showed that infuenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was associated with reduced risk for mortality during infuenza season (risk ratio [95% CI] = 0.52 [0.39-0.69]) and during non-infuenza season (0.79 [0.69-0.90]). Infuenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was associated with lower risk for cardiovascular hospitalization (risk ratio [95% CI] = 0.78 [0.68-0.89]) but not for all-cause hospitalization (1.00 [0.90-1.11]) during infuenza season. Conclusion: Our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end suggests the potential mortality beneft of infuenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in heart failure patients. Large-scale randomized controlled trials should be planned to confrm our observed potential survival beneft of infuenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in these patients."

Theory suggests that low socio-economic (SES) groups are especially likely to benefit. Cue-automaticity describes how repetition of behaviour, initiated by a particular 'cue', in a constant context, leads to the automatic instigation and/or execution of behaviour. Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of cue-automaticity interventions to improve the uptake of adult preventive healthcare, and to consider how this might be applied to the design of interventions to promote preventive dental visiting.",
                                "BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: An electronic search, with citation snowballing, of cue-automaticity interventions to influence adult preventive healthcare use was undertaken.",
                                "RESULTS: Searching identified 11,888 titles and abstracts. Paper screening left 26 papers, of which 6 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. All 6 incorporated an Implementation Intention (I-I) component. Four studies involved cancer screening and 2 involved @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programmes. Five studies showed a significantly positive increase in preventive healthcare use, while one did not.",
                                "CONCLUSIONS: Whilst few studies using cue-automaticity to underpin the promotion of preventive care use have been undertaken, studies that do exist have promising results. As cue-automaticity interventions may be of particular benefit to low SES groups, research is needed to investigate whether cue-automaticity interventions can translate into reducing inequalities in attendance for dental check-ups."

                                "Introduction Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited haematological disorder caused by a single point mutation (Glub6Val) that promotes polymerisation of haemoglobin S and sickling of erythrocytes. Inflammation, haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and organ damage characterise the highly variable clinical expression of SCD. People with SCD are at increased risk of severe infections, hence the need for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against common disease-causing organisms in this population. We aim to review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in people with SCD. Methods and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end The present @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end will examine the current data as indexed in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, CENTRAL, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end and EBSCOHost. We will consult Strategic Advisory Group of Experts practice statements, conference abstracts, reference lists of relevant articles, WHO ICTRP trial registry and experts in the field. Two authors will independently screen search outputs, select studies, extract data and assess risk of bias; resolving discrepancies by discussion and consensus between the two authors or arbitration by a third author when necessary. We will perform a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end for clinically homogenous studies. Evidence from clinically diverse studies will be aggregated using narrative synthesis of the findings. In either case, we will use the GRADE approach to assess the strength of the available evidence. Ethics and dissemination The study draws on data that are readily available in the public domain, hence no formal ethical review and approval is required. The findings of this review will be disseminated through conference presentations and a publication in a peer-reviewed journal."

The aim of this study was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end intervention studies on HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end completion.",
                                "ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Intervention studies with a comparison group that assessed HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end completion rate as the primary outcome variable in adolescents and adults younger than 26years of age, and published in English from 2006 to 2016, were eligible for review.",
                                "SAMPLE: Five studies from a literature search of @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, PsycARTICLES, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases were included in this review.",
                                "RESULTS: The overall quality of the reviewed studies was moderate, and the studies have mainly been conducted in a high-income country. Intervention strategies were DVD-based education on HPV and reminders that were delivered via either electronic or non-electronic methods. Some studies used fixed type of electronic reminders. Others chose preference-based electronic reminders, allowing participants to select one or two delivery options from e-mail, text message, automated telephone message, or Facebook message. Non-electronic reminders were letters sent by standard mail.",

However, this review highlights the need for more high-quality studies to identify the best way to promote @hit_startvaccination@hit_end completion."
