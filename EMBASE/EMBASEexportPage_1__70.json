                                "Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific effector CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells are critical for viral clearance. To determine the effects of HBV-specific effector CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells on HBV infection, we performed a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of the available literature. Methods: Electronic database searches identified appropriately designed studies that detected specific CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells in HBV-infected patients. Our main endpoints were the course of infection, seroconversion of HBV \u201ce\u201d antigen (HBeAg), the level of HBVDNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. We used a fixed/random model for @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, according to the results of a heterogeneity test (P value of Q-squared, I@sup_begin2@sup_end). Results: Our searches found five eligible articles. Pooled estimation of the reported results showed that levels of specific CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells were significantly higher in patients with acute hepatitis B than in patients with chronic hepatitis B (odds ratio [OR] = 76.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.37\u2013378.70). With respect to chronic hepatitis B, patients with <10@sup_begin7@sup_end copies/ml HBVDNA had higher levels of specific CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells relative to patients with >10@sup_begin7@sup_end copies/ml HBVDNA, but the difference had no statistics significance (OR: 3.89, 95% CI: 0.71\u201321.33). Patients with negative HBeAg or positive anti-HBeAg antibody (anti-HBe) results had significantly higher levels of specific CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells versus patients with positive HBeAg results (OR: 5.82, 95% CI: 1.41\u201324.13). There were no significant associations between the levels of specific CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells and serum ALT activity (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.01\u201374.15). Conclusion: HBV-specific effector CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells influence the disease activity in HBV-infected patients in various ways and determine prognosis by eliminating the virus. Therefore, efforts of studying HBV-specific effector CD8@sup_begin+@sup_end T cells focused @hit_startvaccine@hit_end are potentially needed."

                                "Background: Mathematical transmission models are increasingly used to guide public health interventions for infectious diseases, particularly in the context of emerging pathogens; however, the contribution of modeling to the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate publications on population-level transmission models of AMR over a recent period (2006-2016) to gauge the state of research and identify gaps warranting further work. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify transmission studies of AMR in viral, bacterial, and parasitic disease systems. We @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end the temporal, geographic, and subject matter trends, described the predominant medical and behavioral interventions studied, and identified central findings relating to key pathogens. Results: We identified 273 modeling studies; the majority of which (> 70%) focused on 5 infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)). AMR studies of influenza and nosocomial pathogens were mainly set in industrialized nations, while HIV, TB, and malaria studies were heavily skewed towards developing countries. The majority of articles focused on AMR exclusively in humans (89%), either in community (58%) or healthcare (27%) settings. Model systems were largely compartmental (76%) and deterministic (66%). Only 43% of models were calibrated against epidemiological data, and few were validated against out-of-sample datasets (14%). The interventions considered were primarily the impact of different drug regimens, hygiene and infection control measures, screening, and diagnostics, while few studies addressed de novo resistance, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategies, economic, or behavioral changes to reduce antibiotic use in humans and animals. Conclusions: The AMR modeling literature concentrates on disease systems where resistance has been long-established, while few studies pro-actively address recent rise in resistance in new pathogens or explore upstream strategies to reduce overall antibiotic consumption. Notable gaps include research on emerging resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; AMR transmission at the animal-human interface, particularly in agricultural and veterinary settings; transmission between hospitals and the community; the role of environmental factors in AMR transmission; and the potential of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to combat AMR."

                                "Background: Planning and monitoring @hit_startvaccine@hit_end introduction and effectiveness relies on strong @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end disease (VPD) surveillance. In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) especially, cost is a commonly reported barrier to VPD surveillance system maintenance and performance; however, it is rarely calculated or assessed. This review describes and compares studies on the availability of cost information for VPD surveillance systems in LMICs to facilitate the design of future cost studies of VPD surveillance. Methods: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Web of Science, and EconLit were used to identify peer-reviewed articles and Google was searched for relevant grey literature. Studies selected described characteristics and results of VPD surveillance systems cost studies performed in LMICs. Studies were categorized according to the type of VPD surveillance system, study aim, the annual cost of the system, and per capita costs. Results: Eleven studies were identified that assessed the cost of VPD surveillance systems. The studies assessed systems from six low-income countries, two low-middle-income countries, and three middle-income countries. The majority of the studies (n = 7) were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and fifteen distinct VPD surveillance systems were assessed across the studies. Most studies aimed to estimate incremental costs of additional surveillance components and presented VPD surveillance system costs as mean annual costs per resource category, health structure level, and by VPD surveillance activity. Staff time/personnel cost represents the largest cost driver, ranging from 21% to 61% of total VPD surveillance system costs across nine studies identifying a cost driver. Conclusions: This review provides a starting point to guide LMICs to invest and advocate for more robust VPD surveillance systems. Critical gaps were identified including limited information on the cost of laboratory surveillance, challenges with costing shared resources, and missing data on capital costs. Appropriate guidance is needed to guide LMICs conducting studies on VPD surveillance system costs."

                                "Objectives: To @hit_startreview@hit_end the @hit_startliterature@hit_end on economic evaluation of dengue @hit_startvaccination@hit_end to produce evidence to support a local cost-effectiveness study and to subsidize the decision to introduce a dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in the Brazilian National @hit_startImmunization@hit_end Program. Methods: We systematically searched multiple databases (@hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (via @hit_startPubMed@hit_end), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, SCOPUS, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), HTA Database (via Centre for Reviews and Dissemination \u2013 CRD) and LILACS), selecting full HEEs of dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Two independent reviewers screened articles for relevance and extracted the data. The methodology for the quality reporting was assessed using CHEERS checklist. We performed a qualitative narrative synthesis. Results: Thirteen studies conducted in Asian and Latin America countries were reviewed. All studies were favorable to the incorporation of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. However, the assumptions and values assumed for @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy, safety and duration of protection, as well as the choice of the study population and the type of model used in the @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, associated to an insufficient reporting of the methodological steps, affect the validity of the studies\u2019 results. The quality reporting appraisal showed that the majority (8/13) of the studies reported less than 55% of the CHEERS checklists\u2019 items. Conclusions: This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end shows that the economic evaluation of dengue @hit_startvaccination@hit_end did not adhere to key recommended general methods for economic evaluation. The presented cost-effectiveness results should not be transferred to other countries. It is recommended to conduct studies with local epidemiological and cost data, as well as assumptions about @hit_startvaccination@hit_end that reflect the results observed in clinical trials."

                                "Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and bacteremia. The mortality and morbidity of invasive pneumococcal disease are high among adults aged >65 years or those with underlying chronic or immunosuppressive conditions. A recent @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end showed that patients treated with immunosuppressive agents have impaired immune responses to pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared with healthy subjects. A more favorable response is observed in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha-blocking agents compared with those treated with other immunosuppressive agents. Low systemic corticosteroid doses do not affect the responses to pneumococcal @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis receiving immunosuppressive therapy exhibit decreased immunogenicity to pneumococcal @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. The effects of T-cell-dependent PCV possibly depend on host memory B cells in some disease conditions. Several immunosuppressive therapy types and disease conditions may affect the responses to pneumococcal @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. @hit_startImmunization@hit_end should be administered before immunosuppressive medication initiation whenever possible."

                                "Currently, many countries are dealing with groups refusing available recommended @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end. Despite several studies having demonstrated the efficacy of mandatory @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end in ensuring herd @hit_startimmunity@hit_end, opposition is widespread. The aim of our study was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end published studies evaluating attitudes towards mandatory @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programs. @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Scopus scientific databases were searched and 4,198 results were returned, of these 29 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two studies assessed attitudes towards mandatory @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programs in general, while 9 papers focused specifically on the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Most of the studies were performed in Europe and North America. According to the assessed studies, the majority of the population seems to be in favour of compulsory @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end, although attitudes differed among studies. The results presented in this review could be an important starting point to further understand the issue of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end hesitancy and support the implementation of effective @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategies."

                                "Introduction: Subcutaneous nodules are a rare adverse event following @hit_startimmunization@hit_end (AEFI). Reported cases have frequently been associated with aluminum-containing @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Despite the development of a consensus definition of a subcutaneous nodule from the Brighton Collaboration in 2004, there continues to be variation in definitions used in published literature. Areas covered: We @hit_startreviewed@hit_end the @hit_startliterature@hit_end regarding subcutaneous nodule etiology, definition, clinical features, management, and approach to future immunizations. @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end databases were searched with relevant MeSH terms initially on 8 November 2016, the same searches were repeated on 9 September 2018 prior to finalizing this review. We reviewed published case reports and larger studies reporting subcutaneous nodules and also reviewed articles discussing broader use of aluminum in immunizations and AEFIs. Expert commentary: Consensus from clinicians regarding the approach to management of subcutaneous nodules is vital. We believe that the safety concerns regarding aluminum causing subcutaneous nodules are far outweighed by the benefits of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end containing aluminum. Ultimately, supporting subsequent immunizations in individuals that develop nodules needs to be a priority."

                                "Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has long been thought to be the model disease for immunotherapy with its characteristic BCR-ABL fusion protein. Although targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is highly effective at inducing remission, most patients require life-long TKI to decrease the risk of relapse. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to finding ways to eliminate CML stem cells (LSCs); the source of disease persistence. Areas covered: In this review, the authors present recent immunologic findings pertinent to CML, @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end targeting leukemia antigens, interferon combination therapies, and other emerging strategies aimed at increasing immunogenicity and improving outcomes in patients with CML. Recent publications and abstracts found in @hit_startPubmed@hit_end and hematology/oncology meetings related to these topics were identified and incorporated into this review. Expert commentary: Further understanding of the immune system and antigenic composition of LSCs has allowed for novel therapeutic development. Immunotherapies are effective at the malignant stem cell level and combining these approaches with TKI is a promising option. Despite ongoing challenges, it is increasingly recognized that a cure may be achievable through immunotherapies."

                                "Background: Despite growing access to effective therapies, asthma control still needs improvement. Many non-drug factors, such as allergens, air pollutants and stress also affect asthma control and patient quality of life, but an overview of the effectiveness of non-drug interventions on asthma control was lacking. Objectives: To identify non-drug interventions likely to improve asthma control. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the available literature in @hit_startMedline@hit_end and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library was conducted in March 2017, without any time limit. Initial searching identified 884 potentially relevant clinical trial reports, @hit_startliterature reviews@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end, which were screened for inclusion using criteria of quality, relevance, and reporting outcomes based on asthma control. Results: Eighty-two publications met the inclusion criteria. In general, the quality of the studies was low. Patient education programmes (22 studies) significantly improved asthma control. Multifaceted interventions (10 studies), which combined patient education programmes with decreasing exposure to indoor allergens and pollutants, significantly improved asthma control based on clinically relevant outcomes. Renovating homes to reduce exposure to allergens and indoor pollutants improved control (two studies). Air filtration systems (five studies) were effective, especially in children exposed to second-hand smoke. Most measures attempting to reduce exposure to dust mites were ineffective (five studies). Dietary interventions (eight studies) were ineffective. Promoting physical activity (five studies) tended to yield positive results, but the results did not attain significance. Conclusion: Twenty-six interventions were effective in asthma control. Simultaneously combining several action plans, each focusing on different aspects of asthma management, seems most likely to be effective."

                                "Background: Without clear evidence, selecting among the existing immunotherapeutic options for warts remains challenging. Objective: Through network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end, we aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of different intralesional immunotherapeutic modalities. Methods: We included randomized controlled trials comparing intralesional immunotherapeutic modalities to cryotherapy, placebo, or imiquimod. All outcomes were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Both conventional and network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end (with a frequentist approach) were conducted on R software. The P-score was used to rank different treatments. Results: Network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of 17 randomized controlled trials (1676 patients) showed that PPD (purified protein derivative @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, OR 39.56), MMR (measles, mumps, rubella @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, OR 17.46) and interferon \u03b2 (OR 15.55) had the highest efficacy in terms of complete recovery at the primary site compared with placebo. Regarding complete recovery at the distant site, autoinoculation (OR 79.95), PPD (OR 42.95), and MMR (OR 15.39) were all statistically superior to placebo. According to the P-score, MMR was more effective than other modalities in reducing the recurrence rate at the same site. Limitations: Relatively small sample size in some comparisons and variability in baseline characteristics. Conclusion: PPD and MMR were the most effective in achieving complete primary and distant recovery (along with autoinoculation for distant recovery) and reducing the recurrence rate at the same site compared with cryotherapy and other immunotherapeutic modalities."
