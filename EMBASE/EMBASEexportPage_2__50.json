                                "Background Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is associated with high personal and economic burden. Recently, new treatment options for castration-resistant prostate cancer became available with promising survival advantages. However, cost-effectiveness of those new treatment options is sometimes ambiguous or given only under certain circumstances. The aim of this study was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end studies on the cost-effectiveness of treatments and costs of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastasizing castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) on their methodological quality and the risk of bias. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in the databases @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end Complete, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and Web of Science Core Collection for costs-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, model-based economic evaluations, cost-of-illness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end and budget impact @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Reported costs were inflated to 2015 US$ purchasing power parities. Quality assessment and risk of bias assessment was performed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist and the Bias in Economic Evaluations checklist, respectively. Results In total, 38 articles were identified by the systematic literature search. The methodological quality of the included studies varied widely, and there was considerable risk of bias. The cost-effectiveness treatments for CRPC and mCRPC was assessed with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominance for mitoxantrone to $562,328 per quality-adjusted life year gained for sipuleucel-T compared with prednisone alone. Annual costs for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer ranged from $3,067 to $77,725. Conclusion The cost-effectiveness of treatments of CRPC strongly depended on the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year gained/life-year saved throughout all included costs-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end and model-based economic evaluations. High-quality cost-effectiveness @hit_startanalyses@hit_end based on randomized controlled trials are needed in order to make informed decisions on the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer and the resulting financial impact on the healthcare system."

                                "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease, with its mortality rate approaching its incidence rate every year. Accordingly, much interest has been generated in harnessing the immune system in order to improve survival outcomes for these patients. Pancreatic cancer is not thought to be as immunogenic as other cancers that have seen promising results with immune checkpoint inhibitors alone, therefore likely several targets within the cancer-@hit_startimmunity@hit_end cycle will need to be employed for successful treatment. We sought to investigate both the current state of the field in immunotherapy in PDAC with a special emphasis on combined approaches with radiation therapy (RT). We also summarized ongoing clinical trials that are examining the use of radiotherapy with other immune-stimulating agents in the treatment of PDAC. A @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and clinicaltrials.gov search was conducted using the following search terms, either alone or in combination: \u201cpancreatic cancer\u201d, \u201cimmunotherapy\u201d, and \u201cabscopal effect\u201d. Open clinical trials were reviewed and included if they involved both RT and other immune-stimulating agents. Pancreatic cancers tend to reside within immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments (TME), express PD-L1, and secrete several immuno-suppressive agents, such as TGF-B, IL-10, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, galectin-1. Whole-cell @hit_startvaccine@hit_end therapies, peptide and protein @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, dendritic cell @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, and @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with microorganisms have been investigated by themselves with promising results. Open clinical trials are currently investigating the use of these @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, which increase antigen presentation, with treatments that stimulate release of tumor antigens including RT. There are currently at least 21 open clinical trials investigating the combination of RT with other immune-stimulating agents. The combination of RT and immunotherapy may be a promising avenue for PDAC treatment and deserves further research."

                                "Introduction The human papillomavirus (HPV) is currently one of the most prevalent causes of sexually transmitted diseases amongst women, affecting around 10% of the global population. Data collected has shown that distribution patterns of HPV differ between countries around the globe. Methods A combination of @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end, @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end and clinical studies were used to recognise the geographic variation of HPV strains. Results Although there is little discrepancy in the prevalence of HPV16 and 18 amongst cervical malignancies internationally, other HPV genotypes vary geographically. Current prophylactic @hit_startvaccines@hit_end largely target HPV16 and 18; therefore, those infected with non-HPV16/18 variants remain unprotected. Asia demonstrates an increased prevalence in the strain HPV58 with little found anywhere else, and this is thought to be as a result of factors affecting host genetics, specifically those found to carry a certain haplotype polymorphism-HLA-DQB1\u221706. In Africa, strains HPV35 and 45 are most ubiquitous due to environmental factors including the rampant levels of HIV as well as lack of medical facilities/education. In Southern America, HPV33 has a dominant prevalence. This is thought to be due to socioeconomic reasons rather than biological. Conclusion The disproportionately high burden of HPV and cervical carcinomas in less economically developed countries is mainly due to the lack of access to adequate healthcare. Though prophylactic @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are available to most parts of the world, they do not provide adequate cross-type protection. Protecting against nine HPV types, the new @hit_startvaccine@hit_end Gardasil 9 has promising outcomes."

                                "Objective: To evaluate the immunogenicity of inactivated quadrivalent influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (QIV) in adults aged 18-64 years, through a @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Methods: Literature was retrieved by searching the @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, Science Direct in the past decade. All the studies were under random control trial (RCT) and including data related to immunogenicity which involving sero-protection rate (SPR) and sero-conversion rate (SCR) of the QIV, versus inactivated trivalent influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (TIV) in the population aged 18 to 64. Revman 5.3 software was employed to manipulate the pooled date of the included literature. Result A total of 8 studies for the SPR and SCR of the shared strains (two A lineage and one B lineage) were included. There appeared no significant differences in the response rates between the two @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. As for QIV versus TIV (B/Yamagata), the pooled RR of the SPR for B/Victoria was 1.28 (95%CI: 1.08-1.51, P<0.05), with the pooled RR of the SCR for B/Victoria as 1.94 (95%CI: 1.50-2.50, P<0.05). For QIV versus TIV (B/Victoria), the pooled RR of the SPR for B/Yamagata as 1.10 (95%CI: 1.02-1.18, P<0.05), and the pooled RR of SCR for B/Yamagata as 1.99 (95%CI: 1.34-2.97, P<0.05). Conclusion: In the population aged 18-64 years, inactivated QIV was equivalently immunogenic against the shared three strains included in the activated TIV while a superior immunogenic effect was noticed in the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end strain which did not include the inactivated QIV."

                                "The basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) can be considerably higher in an SIR model with heterogeneous mixing compared to that from a corresponding model with homogeneous mixing. For example, in the case of measles, mumps and rubella in San Diego, CA, Glasser et al. (Lancet Infect Dis 16(5):599-605, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)00004-9 ), reported an increase of 70% in [Formula: see text] when heterogeneity was accounted for. @hit_startMeta@hit_end-population models with simple heterogeneous mixing functions, e.g., proportionate mixing, have been employed to identify optimal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategies using an approach based on the gradient of the effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]), which consists of partial derivatives of [Formula: see text] with respect to the proportions immune [Formula: see text] in sub-groups i (Feng et al. in J Theor Biol 386:177-187, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.09.006 ; Math Biosci 287:93-104, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2016.09.013 ). These papers consider cases in which an optimal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategy exists. However, in general, the optimal solution identified using the gradient may not be feasible for some parameter values (i.e., @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverages outside the unit interval). In this paper, we derive the @hit_startanalytic@hit_end conditions under which the optimal solution is feasible. Explicit expressions for the optimal solutions in the case of [Formula: see text] sub-populations are obtained, and the bounds for optimal solutions are derived for [Formula: see text] sub-populations. This is done for general mixing functions and examples of proportionate and preferential mixing are presented. Of special significance is the result that for general mixing schemes, both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are bounded below and above by their corresponding expressions when mixing is proportionate and isolated, respectively."

                                "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a disabling disorder with a considerable impact on patients and patient-related health care costs. Prevalence and incidence rates of CIDP are required to determine the impact of CIDP on society and to identify potential risk factors for developing CIDP, including @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end and infections. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and incidence rates of CIDP and to determine the effect of diagnostic criteria on prevalence and incidence rates. We performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end for all published incidence and prevalence studies on CIDP until the 18th of May 2017. Methodological quality was assessed using the Methodological Evaluation of Observational Research (MORE) checklist. Random effect @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence and incidence rates. Of the 907 studies, 11 were included in the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, 5 in the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of incidence (818 cases; 220 513 514 person-years) and 9 in the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of prevalence (3160 cases; 160 765 325 population). Quality of the included studies was moderate. The pooled crude incidence rate was 0.33 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 0.21-0.53; I-2 = 95.7%) and the pooled prevalence rate was 2.81 per 100 000 (95% CI 1.58-4.39; I-2 = 99.1%). Most CIDP patients were male (gender ratio incidence 1.5-4.0; gender ratio prevalence 1.4-4.4) and the incidence and prevalence of CIDP increased with age. Reported incidence and prevalence showed substantial heterogeneity across studies which seems to be partly explained by the use of different diagnostic criteria. The @hit_startmetaanalysis@hit_end suggest that studies using the AAN criteria found lower prevalence and incidence rates than studies using the EFNS/PNS 2006 and/or EFNS/PNS 2010 criteria. These findings provide a starting point to estimate the social burden due to CIDP and to assess changes in CIDP incidence and prevalence following potential risk factors, but also demonstrate the need to reach consensus on diagnostic criteria for CIDP."

                                "Background The Malaria @hit_startVaccine@hit_end Implementation Program, coordinated by the World Health Organization, intended to initiate the roll-out of the RTS, S/AS01 malaria @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in 3 sub-Saharan African countries in 2018. With sub-optimal implementation, the effectiveness of this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in routine clinical use could be significantly lower than its measured efficacy in randomized trials. This study had as objectives to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end and summarize published studies addressing the challenges faced during the implementation phase of malaria @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programs and randomized trials conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. The review also sought to report proposed solutions to the challenges identified. Method This was a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of studies published between 1947 and 2017. @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end library databases were searched. Of the 365 studies retrieved, 8 eligible studies reported on challenges of implementing a malaria @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in sub-Saharan Africa and possible solutions to these challenges. Data were abstracted from the eligible studies and a qualitative synthesis was done. Results The 8 studies included in the review had a total of 6189 participants and used a variety of methodologies (3 qualitative, 1 quantitative, 3 mixed method studies and 1 clinical trial review). There was an overall positive acceptance towards the new malaria @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (n = 6/8 studies), with a mean acceptance rate of 86.1% (95% CI: 62.0\u2013110.2, n = 2). The main challenges to @hit_startvaccine@hit_end receptivity were: inadequate community engagement due to lack of information about the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (n = 6), fear of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end\u2019s side effects (n = 5), inefficient delivery of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end services to children (n = 4), and sub-optimal quality of the health services (n = 3). Main themes identified from the proposed solutions consisted of the following: using dynamic communication models and trusted sources for delivering @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-related@hit_end health information to the communities (n = 6), community engagement at both national and district level (n = 6), implementing the new @hit_startvaccine@hit_end services alongside the existing health services already delivered (n = 6). Conclusion/Recommendations Effective implementation of the malaria @hit_startvaccine@hit_end program requires careful consideration of the socio-cultural context of each community. The RTS, S/AS01 malaria @hit_startvaccine@hit_end acceptance and uptake may be significantly enhanced if caregivers\u2019 perceptions about @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and their importance are adequately fine-tuned. In order to achieve these, community participation and the provision of adequate information in an acceptable form via reliable communication channels seem to be imperative."

                                "Context: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) constitute about 15% of breast neoplasms. In contrast to estrogen receptor (ER) or human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) positive breast cancers, which respond to hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen) or anti-HER2 therapy (such as trastuzumab), respectively, the main standard therapy in either early or late stage TNBC is chemotherapy. Therefore, it is necessary to find new treatment modalities for TNBC patients. We searched the literature to find published studies on immunotherapy in triple negative breast cancer and the putative biomarkers of response to these treatments. Evidence Acquisition: We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection with these keywords: \u201cTriple negative breast cancer, Immunotherapy, Resistance, Response, Programmed cell death 1 receptor, CTLA-4, Tumor mutation burden, and Immune signature\u201d. Results: TNBC is considered a heterogeneous neoplasm with regard to molecular aberrations. @hit_startAnalysis@hit_end of genomic expression profile of TNBC has delineated 4 subtypes. TNBC tumors show high genetic instability. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are detected more in TNBCs, compared to other breast cancer types. It has been shown that the amount of CD8 positive T cells in TNBCs is an independent predictor of overall survival. Up to now, two immunotherapy strategies have been used in clinical trials of TNBC, including immune checkpoint blockers and therapeutic cancer @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Tumor programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression is the most widely used immunotherapy biomarker. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) can be a promising biomarker of response to immunotherapy. The more somatic mutations a cancer cell has, the more neoantigens it probably produces. @hit_startAnalysis@hit_end of TMB can give an estimate of tumor mutation load. Increased somatic mutation load has also been observed in tumors with impaired mismatch repair (MMR). Conclusions: As TNBC is regarded a heterogeneous disease, the discovery of biomarkers of response to immunotherapy will increase the likelihood of response to these therapies. Further in-depth investigations are needed to find novel biomarkers of response to these immunotherapies for the better management of patients with TNBC."

                                "Importance: Child maltreatment, also referred to as child abuse and neglect, can result in lifelong negative consequences. Objective: To update the evidence on interventions provided in or referable from primary care to prevent child maltreatment for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and trial registries through December 18, 2017; references; experts; literature surveillance through July 17, 2018. Study Selection: English-language fair- and good-quality randomized clinical trials that (1) included children with no known exposure to maltreatment and no signs or symptoms of current or past maltreatment, (2) evaluated interventions feasible in a primary care setting or that could result from a referral from primary care, and (3) reported abuse or neglect outcomes or proxies for abuse or neglect (eg, injury with a specificity for abuse, visits to the emergency department, hospitalization). Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; a third resolved conflicts when needed. When at least 3 similar trials were available, random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Direct measures (including reports to child protective services and removal of the child from the home) or proxy measures of abuse or neglect; behavioral, emotional, mental, or physical well-being; and harms. Results: Twenty-two trials (33 publications) were included (N = 11132). No significant association was found between interventions and reports to child protective services within 1 year of intervention completion (10.6% vs 11.9%; pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.72-1.23]; 10 trials [n = 2444]) or removal of the child from the home within 1 to 3 years of follow-up (3.5% vs 3.7%; pooled OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.16-7.28]; 4 trials [n = 609]). No statistically significant associations were observed between interventions and outcomes for emergency department visits in the short term (<2 years), hospitalizations, child development, school performance, and prevention of death. Nonsignificant results from single trials led to a conclusion of insufficient evidence for injuries, failure to thrive, failure to @hit_startimmunize@hit_end, school attendance, and other measures of abuse or neglect. Inconsistent results led to a conclusion of insufficient evidence for long-term (\u22652 years) outcomes for reports to child protective services (ORs range from 0.48 to 1.13; 3 trials [n = 1690]), emergency department visits (1 of 2 trials reported significant differences) and internalizing and externalizing behavior symptoms (3 of 6 trials reported reductions in behavior difficulties). No eligible trials on harms of interventions were identified. Conclusions and Relevance: Interventions provided in or referable from primary care did not consistently prevent child maltreatment. No evidence on harms is available."

                                "Parents have varied HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end communication needs, which presents a challenge for healthcare providers. To improve communication resources for providers, we sought to characterize HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end messages available in existing educational materials. In fall 2016, we searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, educational material clearinghouses, and Google for English language HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end messages. We extracted messages that a provider might use when raising the topic of HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, answering common questions, and motivating @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Two reviewers independently coded each message. The search identified 267 unique messages about HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Messages generally were long (mean no. of words = 44, standard deviation [SD] = 33) and required a high level of education to read (mean reading grade level = 10, SD = 3). Only 32% of messages were shorter than 25 words, and 12% had a readability at or below grade 6. Most frequent were messages to address common parent questions or concerns (62%); the most common topics were diseases prevented by HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (18%) and safety and side effects (16%). Many messages included information about cancer prevention (26%) and same-day @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (13%). Few messages (6%) used a presumptive style to recommend HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. In conclusion, available messages about HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were markedly varied. We identified few messages that were both brief (to facilitate providers memorizing them) and accessible (to facilitate parents understanding them). Future research should identify which messages lead to HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake."
