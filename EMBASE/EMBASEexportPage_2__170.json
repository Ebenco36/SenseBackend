                                "Background and Aims: VIN is becoming an increasingly problematic disease especially in older women. Although spontaneous regression has been reported (1.2%) VIN/VaIN are considered premalignant conditions with a suggested progression rate greater than that of cervix cancer. Current treatments are inadequate with high recurrence rates therefore ongoing costs of care are high. As HPV DNA is found in over 80% of VIN/VAIN we wanted to @hit_startreview@hit_end the @hit_startliterature@hit_end regarding the role of HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the treatment of women with HPV related VIN/VAIN. Methods: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end. Our search included any type of study design using any form of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in the treatment of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of HPV related VIN and/or VAIN. We excluded studies of other anogenital disease, vulval/vaginal carcinoma and/or studies using @hit_startvaccines@hit_end as prophylaxis. The important clinical outcomes were lesion response to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, symptom improvement, immune response and HPV clearance. Results: We identified 93 articles - only 7 studies (129 women) met our inclusion criteria. Immunocompromised patients were excluded. These studies were all uncontrolled case series published between 2000 - 2017. There were no RCTs identified, and as none of the studies had control groups a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was not possible. Reduction in lesion size was reported by all 7 studies, symptom relief by only 4 studies, HPV clearance, histological regression, and immune response were reported by 6 studies. Follow up was short commonly from 6 months to 1 year. Conclusions: With the introduction of the HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in a primary prevention setting we should see a reduction in the incidence of VIN/VAIN. In the meantime, for patients who have not been @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end, newer treatments with fewer side effects and reduced morbidity are warranted. This review suggests @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effects on lesion size and symptom relief, however, the evidence is of low quality. More studies are required to investigate improved patient outcomes (symptoms and recurrence rates) with the use of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in a therapeutic setting."

                                "Introduction: Screening for Latent Tuberculosis Infections (LTBI) constitutes a key step in health surveillance programs especially among adults of high-risk groups. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end review that aims to critically assess and compare the agreement of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) and Tuberculin Skin Testing (TST) among adults of high-risk groups in Saudi Arabia and compare results with other sites of the Middle East. Methodology: Kappa estimates were @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyzed@hit_end using random effect model and several subgroup @hit_startanalyzes@hit_end were performed to explain overall heterogeneity. Funnel plot, Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s tests were employed to assess overall publication bias. Results: 18 studies were @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyzed@hit_end, comprising 5070 adults of high-risk groups. Pooled kappa estimates from Saudi Arabia (\u03ba = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.41) showed lower rate of agreement compared to other sites of the Middle East (\u03ba = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.41). However, a significant level of heterogeneity (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 96.7%, p > 0.001) were identified across collected evidence. Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s tests confirmed absence of significant publication bias in this review (p = 0.49 and p = 0.16, respectively). Conclusion: This work revealed fair to poor agreement between TST and QFT-GIT, indicating that these two tests are not interchangeable in such settings. Substantial evidence is still needed before considering the sole use of QFT-GIT as an alternative to TST in these populations. Moreover, there is an urgent need for longitudinal studies in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East to accurately assess precision of LTBI diagnosis."

                                "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite the vast diversity of respiratory microbiota, Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most prevalent pathogen among etiologic agents. Despite the significant decrease in the mortality rates for lower respiratory tract infections in recent decades, CAP ranks third as a cause of death in Brazil. Since the latest Guidelines on CAP from the Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisiologia (SBPT, Brazilian Thoracic Association) were published (2009), there have been major advances in the application of imaging tests, in etiologic investigation, in risk stratification at admission and prognostic score stratification, in the use of biomarkers, and in the recommendations for antibiotic therapy (and its duration) and prevention through @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. To review these topics, the SBPT Committee on Respiratory Infections summoned 13 members with recognized experience in CAP in Brazil who identified issues relevant to clinical practice that require updates given the publication of new epidemiological and scientific evidence. Twelve topics concerning diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, and preventive issues were developed. The topics were divided among the authors, who conducted a nonsystematic @hit_startreview@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end, but giving priority to major publications in the specific areas, including original articles, review articles, and @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end. All authors had the opportunity to review and comment on all questions, producing a single final document that was approved by consensus."

                                "Background: The aim of the study was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end the relevant studies to assess the role of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test for predicting patient response to Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Methods: We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library from inception to July 5, 2018, and used Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnosis Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) to assess the quality. We pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of baseline and post-BCG FISH test for predicting tumor recurrence. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and a Fagan nomogram were applied to assess predictive accuracy of post-BCG FISH test. Results: A total of 6 studies with 442 participants for post-BCG test and 404 participants for baseline BCG test were included. The pooled @hit_startanalysis@hit_end for post-BCG FISH test revealed the sensitivity of 0.54 (95% CI 0.38\u20130.69), specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72\u20130.91), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74\u20130.81) for predicting tumor recurrence. Patients with positive post-BCG FISH test were more likely to recur during follow-up (HR 3.95, 95% CI 2.72\u20135.72). The Fagan nomogram revealed the \u201cpost-test\u201d probability of tumor recurrence increased by 29% for patients with positive post-BCG FISH test. The baseline FISH test had a pooled sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.55\u20130.81), specificity of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26\u20130.58), and AUC of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.56\u20130.64) for predicting recurrence. Conclusion: The post-BCG FISH test can predict BCG failure with high specificity and patients with positive post-BCG FISH test were more likely to recur. However, the relatively low sensitivity of post-BCG FISH test and unsatisfactory performance of baseline FISH test may limit their mono-use."

                                "Background: In Australia, community pharmacists are increasingly being integrated into the healthcare system. A range of services in pharmacies are government-funded aiming to prevent chronic diseases and improve the quality use of medicines. The objective of this narrative review is to evaluate the impact of existing pharmacy services and identify opportunities to better address the patients' needs. Methods: A narrative review was undertaken. First, Community Pharmacy Agreement documents between the Australian government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia were reviewed to identify relevant community pharmacy services. Based on these, a literature search was conducted via @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Google Scholar. The included articles were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end and a proposal for further improvement of the programmes was developed. Results: Overall, five areas of community pharmacy interventions were identified: clinical interventions, medication reviews, health promotion, screening and management of chronic diseases, and support services for drug addiction. Pharmacists' interventions have led to improved asthma control, detection of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, reduction in smoking rates and weight, and identification of drug-related problems. The availability of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end services in pharmacies has contributed to increased @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rates. Through support programmes for drug abusers the transmission rate of blood-borne diseases was decreased. Factors that facilitate community pharmacy interventions are skilled staff, remuneration, a designated area in the pharmacy, and good relationships between health professionals. The main barriers are patients' unawareness of existing programmes, pharmacists' lack of confidence and time, and physicians' lack of involvement. To achieve integrated care for patients, the individual services should be better combined, starting with low intensity interventions and proceeding to in-depth services if required. Discussion: Community pharmacies are well located to deliver healthcare services due to convenience and accessibility. The range of services offered by community pharmacies is comprehensive. Despite this, the clinical interventions provided in pharmacies currently appear not to be coordinated. This leads to the proposal that more efforts should be put into linking the individual services. Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of most of the pharmacy services reviewed. However, the potential of the individual services might be further enhanced by interlinking the services and better integrating them with the patient care provided by GPs and other health professionals."

                                "Adjuvant is a substance added to @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to improve the immunogenicity of antigens, and it can induce stronger immune responses and reduce the dosage and production cost of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in populations responding poorly to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Adjuvants in development or in use mainly include aluminum salts, oil emulsions, saponins, immune-stimulating complexes, liposomes, microparticles, nonionic block copolymers, polysaccharides, cytokines and bacterial derivatives. Polysaccharide adjuvants have attracted much attention in the preparation of nano @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and nano drugs because natural polysaccharides have the characteristics of intrinsic immunomodulating, biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and safety. Moreover, it has been proved that a variety of natural polysaccharides possess better immune promoting effects, and they can enhance the effects of humoral, cellular and mucosal immunities. In the present study, we @hit_startsystematically reviewed@hit_end the recent studies on polysaccharides with @hit_startvaccine@hit_end adjuvant activities, including chitosan-based nanoparticles (NPs), glucan, mannose, inulin polysaccharide and Chinese medicinal herb polysaccharide. The application and future perspectives of polysaccharides as adjuvants were also discussed. These findings lay a foundation for the further development of polysaccharide adjuvants. Collectively, more and more polysaccharide adjuvants will be developed and widely used in clinical practice with more in-depth investigations of polysaccharide adjuvants."

                                "Background: Much of the extensive research regarding transmission of malaria is underpinned by mathematical modelling. Compartmental models, which focus on interactions and transitions between population strata, have been a mainstay of such modelling for more than a century. However, modellers are increasingly adopting agent-based approaches, which model hosts, vectors and/or their interactions on an individual level. One reason for the increasing popularity of such models is their potential to provide enhanced realism by allowing system-level behaviours to emerge as a consequence of accumulated individual-level interactions, as occurs in real populations. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of 90 articles published between 1998 and May 2018 was performed, characterizing agent-based models (ABMs) relevant to malaria transmission. The review provides an overview of approaches used to date, determines the advantages of these approaches, and proposes ideas for progressing the field. Results: The rationale for ABM use over other modelling approaches centres around three points: the need to accurately represent increased stochasticity in low-transmission settings; the benefits of high-resolution spatial simulations; and heterogeneities in drug and @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacies due to individual patient characteristics. The success of these approaches provides avenues for further exploration of agent-based techniques for modelling malaria transmission. Potential extensions include varying elimination strategies across spatial landscapes, extending the size of spatial models, incorporating human movement dynamics, and developing increasingly comprehensive parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Conclusion: Collectively, the literature covers an extensive array of topics, including the full spectrum of transmission and intervention regimes. Bringing these elements together under a common framework may enhance knowledge of, and guide policies towards, malaria elimination. However, because of the diversity of available models, endorsing a standardized approach to ABM implementation may not be possible. Instead it is recommended that model frameworks be contextually appropriate and sufficiently described. One key recommendation is to develop enhanced parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Extensions of current techniques will provide the robust results required to enhance current elimination efforts."

                                "Background: This is an update of a @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Review first published in 2015. The conclusions have not changed. Hypodermic needles of different sizes (gauges and lengths) can be used for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end procedures. The gauge (G) refers to the outside diameter of the needle tubing. The higher the gauge number, the smaller the diameter of the needle (e.g. a 23 G needle is 0.6 mm in diameter, whereas a 25 G needle is 0.5 mm in diameter). Many @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are recommended for injection into muscle (intramuscularly), although some are delivered subcutaneously (under the skin) and intradermally (into skin). Choosing an appropriate length and gauge of a needle may be important to ensure that a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is delivered to the appropriate site and produces the maximum immune response while causing the least possible harm. Guidelines conflict regarding the sizes of needles that should be used for @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end children and adolescents. Objectives: To assess the effects of using needles of different sizes for administering @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to children and adolescents on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end immunogenicity (the ability of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to elicit an immune response), procedural pain, and other reactogenicity events (adverse events following @hit_startvaccine@hit_end administration). Search methods: We updated our searches of CENTRAL, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end to October 2017. We also searched proceedings of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end conferences and two trials registers. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of using hypodermic needles of any gauge or length to administer any type of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to people aged from birth to 24 years. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Three review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We rated the quality of evidence using the GRADE system. Main results: We included five trials involving 1350 participants in the original review. The updated review identified no new trials. The evidence from two small trials (one trial including infants and one including adolescents) was insufficient to allow any definitive statements to be made about the effects of the needles evaluated in the trials on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end immunogenicity and reactogenicity. The remaining three trials (1135 participants) contributed data to comparisons between 25 G 25 mm, 23 G 25 mm, and 25 G 16 mm needles. These trials included infants predominantly aged from two to six months undergoing intramuscular @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the anterolateral thigh using the World Health Organization (WHO) injection technique (skin stretched flat, needle inserted at a 90\u00b0 angle and up to the needle hub in healthy infants). The @hit_startvaccines@hit_end administered were combination @hit_startvaccines@hit_end containing diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis antigens (DTwP). In some trials, the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end also contained Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwP-Hib) and hepatitis B (DTwP-Hib-Hep B) antigen components. Primary outcomes Incidence of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases: No trials reported this outcome. Procedural pain and crying: Using a wider gauge 23 G 25 mm needle may slightly reduce procedural pain (low-quality evidence) and probably leads to a slight reduction in the duration of crying time immediately after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (moderate-quality evidence) compared with a narrower gauge 25 G 25 mm needle (one trial, 320 participants). The effects are probably not large enough to be clinically relevant. Secondary outcomes Immune response: There is probably little or no difference in immune response, defined in terms of the proportion of seroprotected infants, between use of 25 G 25 mm, 23 G 25 mm, or 25 G 16 mm needles to administer a series of three doses of a DTwP-Hib @hit_startvaccine@hit_end at ages two, three, and four months (moderate-quality evidence, one trial, numbers of participants in @hit_startanalyses@hit_end range from 309 to 402. The immune response to the pertussis antigen was not measured). Severe and non-severe local reactions: 25 mm needles (either 25 G or 23 G) probably lead to fewer severe and non-severe local reactions after DTwP-Hib @hit_startvaccination@hit_end compared with 25 G 16 mm needles (moderate-quality evidence, one trial, 447 to 458 participants in @hit_startanalyses@hit_end). We estimate that one fewer infant will experience a severe local reaction (extensive redness and swelling) after the first @hit_startvaccine@hit_end dose for every 25 infants @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end with the longer rather than the shorter needle (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with a 25 G 25 mm needle: 25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 15 to 100); NNTB with a 23 G 25 mm needle: 25 (95% CI 17 to 100)). We estimate that one fewer infant will experience a non-severe local reaction (any redness, swelling, tenderness, or hardness (composite outcome)) at 24 hours after the first @hit_startvaccine@hit_end dose for every 5 or 6 infants @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end with a 25 mm rather than a 16 mm needle (NNTB with a 25 G 25 mm needle: 5 (95% CI 4 to 10); NNTB with a 23 G 25 mm needle: 6 (95% CI 4 to 13)). The results are similar after the second and third @hit_startvaccine@hit_end doses. Using a narrow gauge 25 G 25 mm needle may produce a small reduction in the incidence of local reactions after each dose of a DTwP @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared with a wider gauge 23 G 25 mm needle, but the effect estimates are imprecise (low-quality evidence, two trials, 100 to 459 participants in @hit_startanalyses@hit_end). Systemic reactions: The comparative effects of 23 G 25 mm, 25 G 25 mm, and 25 G 16 mm needles on the incidence of postvaccination fever and other systemic events such as drowsiness, loss of appetite, and vomiting are uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. Authors' conclusions: Using 25 mm needles (either 23 G or 25 G) for intramuscular @hit_startvaccination@hit_end procedures in the anterolateral thigh of infants using the WHO injection technique probably reduces the occurrence of local reactions while achieving a comparable immune response to 25 G 16 mm needles. These findings are applicable to healthy infants aged two to six months receiving combination DTwP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with a reactogenic whole-cell pertussis antigen component. These @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are predominantly used in low- and middle-income countries. The applicability of the findings to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with acellular pertussis components and other @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with different reactogenicity profiles is uncertain."

                                "Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were first licensed as a three-dose series; a two-dose series is now recommended in some age groups and there is interest in possible one-dose @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness by number of doses, including assessment of biases and impact of varying buffer periods (time between @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and outcome counting). Results: Of 3787 articles identified, 26 full articles were assessed and 14 included in our review. All studies were conducted within the context of recommended three-dose schedules of bivalent (3) or quadrivalent HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (11). Two evaluated effectiveness for prevention of HPV prevalence, six anogenital warts, and six abnormal cervical cytology or histology. Many studies found differences between three-, two- and one-dose @hit_startvaccine@hit_end recipients, indicating possible differences in HPV exposure prior to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end or in risk behavior. Adjusted or stratified @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were conducted to control for potential confounding. All studies found significant @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness with three doses, 11 with two doses at various intervals, and six with one dose. Most studies showed a relationship (not always statistically significant) between effectiveness and number of doses, with greater decreases in HPV-related outcomes with three, followed by two and one dose(s). Few studies conducted formal comparisons of three vs fewer doses. Three of four studies that examined buffer periods found higher effectiveness and a smaller difference by number of doses with longer periods. Conclusion: Most post-licensure studies report highest effectiveness with three doses; some found no statistically significant difference between two and three doses. Additionally, almost half found some effectiveness with one dose. Several biases impact estimates, with most biasing two- and one-dose results away from showing effectiveness. Future effectiveness studies, examining persons @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end prior to sexual activity and using methods to reduce potential sources of bias, can help inform @hit_startvaccination@hit_end policy."

                                "Objective: To estimate full hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage (uptake of \u22653 doses of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end) among health-care workers (HCWs) in Africa. Methods: We systematically searched the @hit_startPubMed@hit_end\u00ae @hit_startEmbase@hit_end\u00ae @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end and @hit_startPsych-Info@hit_end databases for studies published from January 2010 to October 2017 that reported full hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage among HCWs in Africa. A random effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted to determine pooled estimates of full @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage. Results: Of the 331 articles identified, 35 studies from 15 African countries met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The estimated full hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage was 24.7% (95% CI: 17.3\u201332.0). Regional coverage was highest in northern Africa (62.1%, 95% CI: 42.5\u201381.7) and lowest in central Africa (13.4%, 95% CI: 4.5\u201322.3). Doctors were more likely (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.8\u20133.7) to be fully @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end than Nurses with estimated pooled estimates of 52.4% (95% CI: 31.1\u201373.8) and 26.3% (95% CI: 9.7\u201342.9), respectively. Also, HCWs with 10 or more years of experience were more likely to be @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end than those with less than 10 years of experience (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.5\u20133.3). The common reasons identified for non-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end of HCWs were unavailability of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end 50.5% (95% CI: 26.5\u201374.4), busy work schedule 37.5% (95% CI: 12.6\u201362.4) and cost of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end 18.4% (95% CI: 7.1\u201329.7). Conclusion: The evidence available suggests that many HCWs in Africa are at risk of Hepatitis B infection as only a quarter of them were fully @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end against Hepatitis B virus. This study highlights the need for all African governments to establish and implement hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end policies for HCWs."
