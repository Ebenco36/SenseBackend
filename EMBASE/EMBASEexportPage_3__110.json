                                "Objective: Genital warts and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers in men can be substantially reduced through HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; yet, globally, HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake among boys remains low. This @hit_startmeta@hit_end-ethnography synthesizes qualitative studies to understand, in-depth, HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end acceptability and decision-making among adolescent boys and/or their parents. Methods: A systematic search identified qualitative studies examining HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end from the perspectives of boys and/or boys\u2019 parents. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) 32-item checklist was used to assess quality of reporting. Using @hit_startmeta@hit_end-ethnographic techniques, we conducted a structured and iterative process of data @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, coded original studies, and then developed descriptive and @hit_startanalytic@hit_end themes to synthesize the findings. Results: Review of 15 eligible studies (n = 3362 parents, n = 39 boys) revealed multilevel factors that influence HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end acceptability and decision-making among adolescent boys and their parents: (1) individual, e.g., low HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end knowledge/awareness, (2) interpersonal, e.g., key relationships between parents, sons, and healthcare providers (HCP), (3) community/societal, e.g., parental duty to protect, and (4) systemic, e.g., HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end messaging. Parents generally accepted adolescent boys\u2019 sexuality and the need for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, motivated by wanting to protect their sons from HPV and HPV-associated cancers, and valued HCP-initiated discussion and recommendation. Acceptability was mitigated by low awareness/knowledge of HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and low perceived benefits for boys, lack of HCP-initiated discussion, out-of-pocket costs, multiple doses, stigma, and mixed messages about HPV. Conclusions: Multilevel factors influence HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end acceptability and decision-making among parents and their adolescent sons. Providing clear and unambiguous messages about HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end\u2014for whom (boys and girls), for what (genital warts and cancers in men), and when (before sexual debut)\u2014through increased HCP-initiated discussion and targeted public health campaigns may support HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake among boys. Future research should consistently disaggregate findings by sex of child and parent, and explore effective messaging tailored for boys and parents."

Methods: We searched the @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, Excerpta Medica, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Brazilian Regional Library of Medicine, National Health Service Economic Evaluation, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination\u2014as well as the Scopus citation index and the Web of Science for full economic evaluations of PPV23 published up to March 2016. Two independent reviewers screened the articles for relevance and extracted the data. Main study characteristics and methods (clinical and epidemiological data, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted and compared. Costs were updated to 2016 international dollars. Results: Twenty-seven studies published from 1980 to 2016 were reviewed. Most studies were conducted in Europe and the USA; three studies were conducted in Latin America (Brazil, 2; Colombia, 1). In addition to the scenario comparing the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with the PPV23 to non-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end, three studies also compared PPV23 to pneumococcal conjugate 13-valent @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PCV13). All studies used static models. Most used a lifetime (44.4%) or 5\u20136 year's time horizon (33.3%). Only three studies considered herd protection from children @hit_startimmunization@hit_end with PCV13 in the model. Most studies considered PPV23 cost-effective (less than US$50,000 per LYG or QALY) and sometimes cost-saving (results ranging from cost-saving to US$84,636/QALY). The estimates of disease burden, the efficacy/effectiveness of PPV23, and the effects of herd protection from childhood @hit_startimmunization@hit_end had most influence on the results. Conclusions: Well-designed cost-effectiveness studies of PPV23 that represent the current epidemiological scenario and reduce uncertainty related to efficacy/effectiveness are extremely relevant to informing the decision-making process."

                                "Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease affecting women of childbearing potential. Biologic agents, notably Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi), are the only current non-contraindicated systemic treatment option during pregnancy. TNFi comprised of complete immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies antibodies (adalimumab, golimumab, and infliximab) actively cross the placenta from the second trimester and are detectable in the child up to one year postpartum. Data on safety of TNFi are conflicting; however a trend towards drug-specific harm has been reported, with increased risk of congenital malformations and preterm birth. TNFi exposure may alter the immune system of the infant towards hypersensitivity and reduced response to intracellular infections. Confounding by indication should be considered, as chronic inflammatory disease itself may pose a risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The quality of the current evidence is very low and no studies specifically address TNFi safety in women with psoriasis. Nonetheless, risks associated with TNFi treatment must be balanced against the as-yet uncertain risk of adverse outcomes in infants born to women with severe psoriasis. We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and identified relevant studies and guidelines. Herein, we present the current knowledge of the use and safety of TNFi during pregnancy in women with psoriasis."

                                "Background The seasonal incidence of influenza is often approximated as 5%-20%. Methods We used 2 methods to estimate the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza in the United States. First, we made a statistical estimate extrapolated from influenza-associated hospitalization rates for 2010-2011 to 2015-2016, collected as part of national surveillance, covering approximately 9% of the United States, and including the existing mix of @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end and unvaccinated persons. Second, we performed a literature search and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of published manuscripts that followed cohorts of subjects during 1996-2016 to detect laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza among unvaccinated persons; we adjusted this result to the US median @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage and effectiveness during 2010-2016. Results The statistical estimate of influenza incidence among all ages ranged from 3.0%-11.3% among seasons, with median values of 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.3%-9.7%) for all ages, 9.3% (95% CI, 8.2%-11.1%) for children <18 years, and 8.9% (95% CI, 8.2%-9.9%) for adults 18-64 years. Corresponding values for the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end were 7.1% (95% CI, 6.1%-8.1%) for all ages, 8.7% (95% CI, 6.6%-10.5%) for children, and 5.1% (95% CI, 3.6%-6.6%) for adults. Conclusions The 2 approaches produced comparable results for children and persons of all ages. The statistical estimates are more versatile and permit estimation of season-to-season variation. During 2010-2016, the incidence of symptomatic influenza among @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end and unvaccinated US residents, including both medically attended and nonattended infections, was approximately 8% and varied from 3% to 11% among seasons."

                                "Mounting epidemiological evidence supports the occurrence of a mild herald pandemic wave in the spring and summer of 1918 in North America and Europe, several months before the devastating autumn outbreak that killed an estimated 2% of the global population. These epidemiological findings corroborate the anecdotal observations of contemporary clinicians who reported widespread influenza outbreaks in spring and summer 1918, with sporadic occurrence of unusually severe clinical manifestations in young adults. Initially seen as controversial, these findings were eventually confirmed by retrospective identification of influenza specimens collected from U.S. soldiers who died from acute respiratory infections in May\u2013August 1918. Other studies found that having an episode of influenza illness during the spring herald wave was highly protective in the severe autumn wave. Here, we conduct a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the clinical, epidemiological, and virological evidence supporting the global occurrence of mild herald waves of the 1918 pandemic and place these historic observations in the context of pandemic preparedness. Taken together, historic experience with the 1918 and subsequent pandemics shows that increased severity in second and later pandemic waves may be the rule rather than the exception. Thus, a sustained pandemic response in the first years following a future pandemic is critical; conversely, multiwave pandemic patterns allow for more time to rollout @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and antivirals."

                                "Background: Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, both in healthcare facilities and in the community. The recurrence rate of C. difficile infection (CDI) remains high, up to 20%. Since the publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidance document on CDI treatment in 2014, new therapeutic approaches have been developed and tested to achieve higher sustained clinical cure in CDI. Aim: To review novel treatments and approaches for CDI, except probiotics and @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. We focused on new antibiotics, antibiotic inactivators, monoclonal antibodies and gut microbiota modulating therapies. Sources: A @hit_startliterature review@hit_end was performed for clinical trials published in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end or @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library between January 2013 and November 2017. Content: We @hit_startanalysed@hit_end 28 clinical trials and identified 14 novel agents. Completed phase 2 studies were found for cadazolid, LFF571, ridinilazole and nontoxigenic C. difficile strains. Four phase 3 active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with bezlotoxumab, surotomycin (n = 2) and rifaximin have been published. Seven clinical trials for treatment of multiple recurrent CDI with faecal microbiota transplantation were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end, describing faecal microbiota transplantation by upper or lower gastrointestinal route (n = 5) or by capsules (n = 2). Implications: Metronidazole is mentioned in the ESCMID guideline as first-line therapy, but we propose that oral vancomycin will become the first choice when antibiotic treatment for CDI is necessary. Fidaxomicin is a good alternative, especially in patients at risk of relapse. Vancomycin combined with faecal microbiota transplantation remains the primary therapy for multiple recurrent CDI. We anticipate that new medication that protects the gut microbiota will be further developed and tested to prevent CDI during antibiotic therapy."

                                "Context: Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is currently the most effective intravesical therapy for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, reducing not only recurrence rates but also preventing progression and reducing deaths. However, response rates to BCG vary widely and are dependent on a multitude of factors. Objective: To review existing data on clinical, pathologic, immune, and molecular markers that allow prediction of BCG response. Evidence acquisition: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end search of English language literature was conducted from its inception to July 2017 using appropriate search terms. Following @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of data, consensus voting was used to generate the content of this review. Evidence synthesis: As seen in the EORTC and CUETO risk nomograms, clinicopathologic features, especially tumor stage and grade, are the most effective predictors of BCG response. Data are less robust with regards to the association of response with age, female sex, recurrent tumors, multiplicity of tumors, and the presence of carcinoma in situ. Single biomarkers, such as tumor p53 and urinary interleukin-2 expression, have had limited success in predicting BCG response, possibly due to the multifaceted nature of the generated immune response. More comprehensive biomarker panels (eg, urinary cytokines), have a more robust correlation with response, as do patterns of urinary cytologic fluorescent in-situ hybridization examination. Gene expression data correlate with disease progression, but studies examining potential associations with BCG response are limited. Conclusions: Currently, the best predictors of BCG response are clinicopathologic features such as tumor grade and stage. Panels of urinary cytokines, as well as fluorescent in-situ hybridization patterns of cytologic anomalies, appear to be promising biomarkers. The complexity of the immune response to BCG and the heterogeneity of bladder cancer suggest that future studies should amalgamate measures reflecting innate immune response and tumor/stromal gene expression before these can be adopted for clinical use. Patient summary: Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy is an effective treatment for many patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. An individual's response to BCG can be predicted by using various features of the cancer. In the future, predictive markers using molecular measures of the tumor type and the immune response to BCG may allow us to precisely know an individual's likely outcome after BCG treatment. Predicting response to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin remains elusive. The best available predictors are tumor grade and stage, with biomarker panels such as cytologic fluorescent in-situ hybridization, and cytokine panels (eg, Cytokine Panel for Response to Intravesical Therapy (CyPRIT) assay) which query the complex immunogenic response, holding promise."

                                "Background: Pregnant women were identified as a population of priority for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during the H1N1 influenza pandemic outbreak in 2009. Objectives: To assess adverse fetal outcomes following the administration of H1N1 pandemic @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy. Search strategy: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library were searched up to January 2017. Selection criteria: Cohort studies investigating fetal outcomes after H1N1 influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy were eligible. The language was limited to English. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Pairs of reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies. Main results: A total of 19 cohort studies were eligible. The use of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end during any period of pregnancy was associated with lower risk of stillbirth (adjusted hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.69\u20130.92). No significant differences were found between the @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end versus unvaccinated groups in terms of the risks of spontaneous abortion, premature birth, and small for gestational age. Conclusions: The administration of H1N1 @hit_startvaccines@hit_end during pregnancy might reduce the risk of stillbirth, a complication associated with H1N1 infection. The quality of evidence was, however, not adequate to reach a definitive conclusion."

                                "Introduction: Interleukin-13 and interleukin-4 are type-II cytokines signalling through the shared type II interleukin-4 receptor. As a result of their structural similarity, interleukin-13 and interleukin-4 have overlapping functions in the mediation of type-II-driven diseases and are, therefore, promising targets of biologic drugs currently in development for the treatment of such diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis. Objective: This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was conducted to assess preclinical evidence of potential safety concerns related to blockade of interleukin-13 alone or interleukin-13 and interleukin-4 in combination. Methods: We specifically examined risks related to infection, malignancy and the cardiovascular system. We systematically searched the BIOSIS, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end databases to identify preclinical studies published between January 2006 and October 2016 that addressed the effects of interleukin-13/interleukin-4 blockade and modulation on the risk of infection, malignancy and cardiovascular events. To provide a clinical context, we also performed a search for clinical trials targeting the interleukin-13/interleukin-4 pathways. Relevant data from preclinical and clinical trials were abstracted and presented descriptively. Results: Aside from expected evidence that inhibition of interleukin-13 and interleukin-4 impaired host responses to helminth infections, we did not identify other preclinical evidence suggesting safety risks relating to infection, malignancy or cardiovascular events. We found no evidence in clinical trials suggesting serious safety concerns, i.e. increased risk for infections, malignancy or cardiovascular events from therapeutic modulation of the interleukin-13 pathway alone or the combined interleukin-13/interleukin-4 pathways. Conclusions: Although our findings are reassuring, long-term safety assessments of biologics that target the interleukin-13/interleukin-4 pathways currently in clinical development are needed."

                                "Background: The populations of many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are young. Despite progress made towards achieving Universal Health Coverage and remarkable health gains, evidence suggests that many children in LMIC are still not accessing needed healthcare services. Delayed or lack of access to health services can lead to a worsening of health and can in turn negatively impact a child's ability to attend school, and future employment opportunities. Methods: We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end to assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing access to health services for children over 5 years in LMIC settings. Four electronic databases were searched in March 2017. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions that aimed to increase: healthcare utilisation, @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end uptake and compliance with medication/referral. Randomised controlled trials and non-randomised study designs were included in the review. Data extraction included study characteristics, intervention type and measures of access to health services for children above 5 years of age. Study outcomes were classified as positive, negative, mixed or null in terms of their impact on access outcomes. Results: Ten studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Interventions were evaluated in Nicaragua (1), Brazil (1), Turkey (1), India (1), China (1), Uganda (1), Ghana (1), Nigeria (1), South Africa (1) and Swaziland (1). Intervention types included education (2), incentives (1), outreach (1), SMS/phone call reminders (2) and multicomponent interventions (4). All evaluations reported positive findings on measured health access outcomes; however, the quality and strength of evidence were mixed. Conclusion: This review provides evidence of the range of interventions that were used to increase healthcare access for children above 5 years old in LMIC. Nevertheless, further research is needed to examine each of the identified intervention types and the influence of contextual factors, with robust study designs. There is also a need to assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions to inform decision-makers on which are suitable for scale-up in their particular contexts."
