                                "Background: Because immunological aberrations might be the cause of miscarriage in some women, several immunotherapies have been used to treat women with otherwise unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any immunotherapy, including paternal leukocyte @hit_startimmunization@hit_end and intravenous immunoglobulin on the live birth rate in women with previous unexplained recurrent miscarriages. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (11 February 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomized trials of immunotherapies used to treat women with three or more prior miscarriages and no more than one live birth after, in whom all recognized non-immunologic causes of recurrent miscarriage had been ruled out and no simultaneous treatment was given. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: The review author and the two co-authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality for all studies considered for this review. Main results: Twenty trials of high quality were included. The various forms of immunotherapy did not show significant differences between treatment and control groups in terms of subsequent live births: paternal cell @hit_startimmunization@hit_end (12 trials, 641 women), Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.70; third-party donor cell @hit_startimmunization@hit_end (three trials, 156 women), Peto OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.82; trophoblast membrane infusion (one trial, 37 women), Peto OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.45; or intravenous immunoglobulin, (eight trials, 303 women), Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.58. Authors' conclusions: Paternal cell @hit_startimmunization@hit_end, third-party donor leukocytes, trophoblast membranes, and intravenous immunoglobulin provide no significant beneficial effect over placebo in improving the live birth rate."

                                "Background: Around 16 million cases of whooping cough (pertussis) occur worldwide each year, mostly in low-income countries. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults. Search methods: We updated our searches of the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), which contains the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 2014, Issue 2), accessed from The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1950 to 30 January 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1980 to 30 January 2014), @hit_startAMED@hit_end (1985 to 30 January 2014), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (1980 to 30 January 2014) and LILACS (30 January 2014). We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress. Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and @hit_startvaccines@hit_end) to suppress the cough in whooping cough. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors (SB, KW) independently reviewed additional studies identified by the updated searches in 2012 and 2014. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay. Main results: We included 12 trials of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135), mainly from high-income countries, including a total of 578 participants. Ten trials recruited children (N = 448 participants). Two trials recruited adolescents and adults (N = 130 participants). We considered only three trials to be of high methodological quality (one trial each of diphenhydramine, pertussis immunoglobulin and montelukast). Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials, including a total of 196 participants, reported data in sufficient detail for @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7 to 8.5 (N = 49 participants from one trial). One trial on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02, N = 47 participants) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4, N = 46 participants). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4, N = 11 participants from one trial) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per day (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7, N = 42 participants from two trials). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo (N = 47 participants) reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site). Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for the cough in whooping cough. More high-quality trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of potential antitussive treatments in patients with whooping cough."

Following this action, there was a resurgence of whooping cough. Acellular pertussis (aP) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, containing purified or recombinant Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) antigens, were developed in the hope that they would be as effective, but less reactogenic than the whole-cell @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. This is an update of a @hit_startCochrane@hit_end review first published in 1999, and previously updated in 2012. In this update, we included no new studies. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of acellular pertussis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in children and to compare them with the whole-cell @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 12), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1950 to January week 2, 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to January 2014), Biosis Previews (2009 to January 2014) and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (2009 to January 2014). Selection criteria: We selected double-blind randomised efficacy and safety trials of aP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in children up to six years old, with active follow-up of participants and laboratory verification of pertussis cases. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the studies. Differences in trial design precluded a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of the efficacy data. We pooled the safety data from individual trials using a random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end model. Main results: We included six efficacy trials with a total of 46,283 participants and 52 safety trials with a total of 136,541 participants. Most of the safety trials did not report the methods for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, which made it difficult to assess the risk of bias in the studies. The efficacy of multi-component (three) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end varied from 84% to 85% in preventing typical whooping cough (characterised by 21 or more consecutive days of paroxysmal cough with confirmation of B. pertussis infection by culture, appropriate serology or contact with a household member who has culture-confirmed pertussis), and from 71% to 78% in preventing mild pertussis disease (characterised by seven or more consecutive days of cough with confirmation of B. pertussis infection by culture or appropriate serology). In contrast, the efficacy of one- and two-component @hit_startvaccines@hit_end varied from 59% to 78% against typical whooping cough and from 41% to 58% against mild pertussis disease. Multi-component acellular @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are more effective than low-efficacy whole-cell @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, but may be less effective than the highest-efficacy whole-cell @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Most systemic and local adverse events were significantly less common with aP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end than with wP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for the primary series as well as for the booster dose. Authors' conclusions: Multi-component (three) aP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are effective in preventing whooping cough in children. Multi-component aP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end have higher efficacy than low-efficacy wP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, but they may be less efficacious than the highest-efficacy wP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Acellular @hit_startvaccines@hit_end have fewer adverse effects than whole-cell @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for the primary series as well as for booster doses."

                                "Background: Despite advances in chemotherapy, prognosis of ovarian cancer remains poor. Antigen-specific active immunotherapy aims to induce tumour-antigen-specific anti-tumour immune responses as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. Objectives: To assess the feasibility of antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer. Primary outcomes are clinical efficacy and antigen-specific immunogenicity with carrier-specific immunogenicity and side effects as secondary outcomes. Search methods: For the previous version of this @hit_startreview@hit_end, a @hit_startsystematic@hit_end search of the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2009, Issue 3, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialized Register, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end databases and clinicaltrials.gov was performed (1966 to July 2009). We conducted handsearches of the proceedings of relevant annual meetings (1996 to July 2009). For this update of the review the searches were extended to October 2013. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non-randomised non-controlled studies that included participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of stage of disease, and treated with antigen-specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two reviews authors independently performed the data extraction. Risk of bias was evaluated for RCTs according to standard methodological procedures expected by The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Collabororation or for non-RCTs using a selection of quality domains deemed best applicable to the non-randomised non-controlled studies. Main results: Fifty-five studies were included (representing 3051 women with epithelial ovarian cancer). Response definitions showed substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events was frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and non-RCTs frequently lacked the relevant information necessary to assess risk of bias. Serious biases in most of the included trials can therefore not be ruled out. The largest body of evidence is currently available for CA-125 targeted antibody therapy (16 studies: 2339 participants). Non-RCTs of CA-125 targeted antibody therapy suggests increased survival in humoral and/or cellular responders. However, four large randomised placebo-controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of participants. Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens showed promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results, limited side effects and toxicity exploration of clinical efficacy in large well-designed RCTs may be worthwhile. Authors' conclusions: We conclude that despite promising immunological responses, no clinically effective antigen-specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Results should be interpreted cautiously as there was a significant lack of relevant information for the assessment of risk of bias in both RCTs and non-RCTs."

                                "Background: Invasive pneumococcal disease is associated with significant mortality and many countries have introduced routine pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end into their childhood @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end programmes. Whilst pneumococcal disease in cystic fibrosis is uncommon, pneumococcal @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end may offer some protection against pulmonary exacerbations caused by this pathogen. In the USA and UK pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is currently recommended for all children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Objectives: To assess the efficacy of pneumococcal @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in reducing morbidity in people with cystic fibrosis. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. In addition, the pharmaceutical manufacturers of the polysaccharide and conjugate pneumococcal @hit_startvaccines@hit_end were approached. Date of the most recent search: 15 May 2014. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (with either a polysaccharide or conjugate pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end) with non-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end or placebo in children or adults with cystic fibrosis were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: No relevant trials were identified. Main results: There are no trials included in this review. Authors' conclusions: As no trials were identified we cannot draw conclusions on the efficacy of routine pneumococcal @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end in people with cystic fibrosis in reducing their morbidity or mortality. As many countries now include pneumococcal @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end in their routine childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedule it is unlikely that future randomised controlled trials will be initiated. Rigorously conducted epidemiological studies may offer the opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in reducing morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis."

                                "Background: The effectiveness of interventions to increase the uptake of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in people aged 60 and older is uncertain. Objectives: To assess access, provider, system and societal interventions to increase the uptake of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in people aged 60 years and older in the community. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (January 1950 to May week 3 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1980 to June 2014), AgeLine (1978 to 4 June 2014), ERIC (1965 to June 2014) and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (1982 to June 2014). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to increase influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake in people aged 60 and older. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake data. Main results: This update identified 13 new RCTs; the review now includes a total of 57 RCTs with 896,531 participants. The trials included community-dwelling seniors in high-income countries. Heterogeneity limited @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. The percentage of trials with low risk of bias for each domain was as follows: randomisation (33%); allocation concealment (11%); blinding (44%); missing data (49%) and selective reporting (100%). Increasing community demand (32 trials, 10 strategies) The interventions with a statistically significant result were: three trials (n = 64,200) of letter plus leaflet/postcard compared to letter (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.15); two trials (n = 614) of nurses/pharmacists educating plus @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end patients (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.91 to 5.66); single trials of a phone call from a senior (n = 193) (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.79 to 6.22), a telephone invitation versus clinic drop-in (n = 243) (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.55 to 4.76), a free groceries lottery (n = 291) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.76) and nurses educating and @hit_startvaccinating@hit_end patients (n = 485) (OR 152.95, 95% CI 9.39 to 2490.67). We did not pool the following trials due to considerable heterogeneity: postcard/letter/pamphlets (16 trials, n = 592,165); tailored communications (16 trials, n = 388,164); customised letter/phone-call (four trials, n = 82,465) and client-based appraisals (three trials, n = 4016), although several trials showed the interventions were effective. Enhancing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end access (10 trials, six strategies) The interventions with a statistically significant result were: two trials (n = 2112) of home visits compared to clinic invitation (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.61); two trials (n = 2251) of free @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.98 to 2.82) and one trial (n = 321) of patient group visits (OR 24.85, 95% CI 1.45 to 425.32). One trial (n = 350) of a home visit plus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end encouragement compared to a home visit plus safety advice was non-significant. We did not pool the following trials due to considerable heterogeneity: nurse home visits (two trials, n = 2069) and free @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared to no intervention (two trials, n = 2250). Provider- or system-based interventions (17 trials, 11 strategies) The interventions with a statistically significant result were: two trials (n = 2815) of paying physicians (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.77); one trial (n = 316) of reminding physicians about all their patients (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.99); one trial (n = 8376) of posters plus postcards (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.22); one trial (n = 1360) of chart review/feedback (OR 3.43, 95% CI 2.37 to 4.97) and one trial (n = 27,580) of educational outreach/feedback (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81). Trials of posters plus postcards versus posters (n = 5753), academic detailing (n = 1400) and increasing staffvaccination rates (n = 26,432) were non-significant. We did not pool the following trials due to considerable heterogeneity: reminding physicians (four trials, n = 202,264) and practice facilitators (three trials, n = 2183), although several trials showed the interventions were effective. Interventions at the societal level We identified no RCTs of interventions at the societal level. Authors' conclusions: There are interventions that are effective for increasing community demand for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, enhancing access and improving provider/system response. Heterogeneity limited pooling of trials."

                                "Background: The prevention of varicella (chickenpox) using live attenuated varicella @hit_startvaccines@hit_end has been demonstrated both in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and in population-based @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end programmes in countries such as the United States and Australia. Many countries do not routinely @hit_startimmunise@hit_end children against varicella and exposures continue to occur. Although the disease is often mild, complications such as secondary bacterial infection, pneumonitis and encephalitis occur in about 1% of cases, usually leading to hospitalisation. The use of varicella @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in persons who have recently been exposed to the varicella zoster virus has been studied as a form of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for use as PEP for the prevention of varicella in children and adults. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1966 to March week 1, 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (January 1990 to March 2014) and LILACS (1982 to March 2014). We searched for unpublished trials registered on the clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP websites. Selection criteria: RCTs and quasi-RCTs of varicella @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for PEP compared with placebo or no intervention. The outcome measures were efficacy in prevention of clinical cases and/or laboratory-confirmed clinical cases and adverse events following @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently extracted and @hit_startanalysed@hit_end data using Review Manager software. Main results: We identified three trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The included trials varied in study quality, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. We identified high or unclear risk of bias in two of the three included studies. Overall, 13 out of 56 @hit_startvaccine@hit_end recipients (23%) developed varicella compared with 42 out of 54 placebo (or no @hit_startvaccine@hit_end) recipients (78%). Of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end recipients who developed varicella, the majority only had mild disease (with fewer than 50 skin lesions). In the three trials, most participants received PEP within three days following exposure; too few participants were @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end four to five days post-exposure to ascertain the efficacy of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end given more than three days after exposure. No included trial reported on adverse events following @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end. Authors' conclusions: These small trials suggest varicella @hit_startvaccine@hit_end administered within three days to children following household contact with a varicella case reduces infection rates and severity of cases. We identified no RCTs for adolescents or adults. Safety was not adequately addressed."

                                "Background: Many @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end exist on interventions to improve safe and effective medicines use by consumers, but research is distributed across diseases, populations and settings. The scope and focus of such reviews also vary widely, creating challenges for decision-makers seeking to inform decisions by using the evidence on consumers' medicines use. This is an update of a 2011 @hit_startoverview@hit_end of @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end, which synthesises the evidence, irrespective of disease, medicine type, population or setting, on the effectiveness of interventions to improve consumers' medicines use. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions which target healthcare consumers to promote safe and effective medicines use, by synthesising review-level evidence. Methods: Search methods: We included @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end published on the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Database of @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. We identified relevant reviews by handsearching databases from their start dates to March 2012. Selection criteria: We screened and ranked reviews based on relevance to consumers' medicines use, using criteria developed for this overview. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used standardised forms to extract data, and assessed reviews for methodological quality using the AMSTAR tool. We used standardised language to summarise results within and across reviews; and gave bottom-line statements about intervention effectiveness. Two review authors screened and selected reviews, and extracted and @hit_startanalysed@hit_end data. We used a taxonomy of interventions to categorise reviews and guide syntheses. Main results: We included 75 @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end of varied methodological quality. Reviews assessed interventions with diverse aims including support for behaviour change, risk minimisation and skills acquisition. No reviews aimed to promote systems-level consumer participation in medicines-related activities. Medicines adherence was the most frequently-reported outcome, but others such as knowledge, clinical and service-use outcomes were also reported. Adverse events were less commonly identified, while those associated with the interventions themselves, or costs, were rarely reported. Looking across reviews, for most outcomes, medicines self-monitoring and self-management programmes appear generally effective to improve medicines use, adherence, adverse events and clinical outcomes; and to reduce mortality in people self-managing antithrombotic therapy. However, some participants were unable to complete these interventions, suggesting they may not be suitable for everyone. Other promising interventions to improve adherence and other key medicines-use outcomes, which require further investigation to be more certain of their effects, include: simplified dosing regimens: with positive effects on adherence; interventions involving pharmacists in medicines management, such as medicines reviews (with positive effects on adherence and use, medicines problems and clinical outcomes) and pharmaceutical care services (consultation between pharmacist and patient to resolve medicines problems, develop a care plan and provide follow-up; with positive effects on adherence and knowledge). Several other strategies showed some positive effects, particularly relating to adherence, and other outcomes, but their effects were less consistent overall and so need further study. These included: delayed antibiotic prescriptions: effective to decrease antibiotic use but with mixed effects on clinical outcomes, adverse effects and satisfaction; practical strategies like reminders, cues and/or organisers, reminder packaging and material incentives: with positive, although somewhat mixed effects on adherence; education delivered with self-management skills training, counselling, support, training or enhanced follow-up; information and counselling delivered together; or education/information as part of pharmacist-delivered packages of care: with positive effects on adherence, medicines use, clinical outcomes and knowledge, but with mixed effects in some studies; financial incentives: with positive, but mixed, effects on adherence. Several strategies also showed promise in promoting @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end uptake, but require further study to be more certain of their effects. These included organisational interventions; reminders and recall; financial incentives; home visits; free @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; lay health worker interventions; and facilitators working with physicians to promote @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end uptake. Education and/or information strategies also showed some positive but even less consistent effects on @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end uptake, and need further assessment of effectiveness and investigation of heterogeneity. There are many different potential pathways through which consumers' use of medicines could be targeted to improve outcomes, and simple interventions may be as effective as complex strategies. However, no single intervention assessed was effective to improve all medicines-use outcomes across all diseases, medicines, populations or settings. Even where interventions showed promise, the assembled evidence often only provided part of the picture: for example, simplified dosing regimens seem effective for improving adherence, but there is not yet sufficient information to identify an optimal regimen. In some instances interventions appear ineffective: for example, the evidence suggests that directly observed therapy may be generally ineffective for improving treatment completion, adherence or clinical outcomes. In other cases, interventions may have variable effects across outcomes. As an example, strategies providing information or education as single interventions appear ineffective to improve medicines adherence or clinical outcomes, but may be effective to improve knowledge an important outcome for promoting consumers' informed medicines choices. Despite a doubling in the number of reviews included in this updated overview, uncertainty still exists about the effectiveness of many interventions, and the evidence on what works remains sparse for several populations, including children and young people, carers, and people with multimorbidity. Authors' conclusions: This overview presents evidence from 75 reviews that have synthesised trials and other studies evaluating the effects of interventions to improve consumers' medicines use. Systematically assembling the evidence across reviews allows identification of effective or promising interventions to improve consumers' medicines use, as well as those for which the evidence indicates ineffectiveness or uncertainty. Decision makers faced with implementing interventions to improve consumers' medicines use can use this overview to inform decisions about which interventions may be most promising to improve particular outcomes. The intervention taxonomy may also assist people to consider the strategies available in relation to specific purposes, for example, gaining skills or being involved in decision making. Researchers and funders can use this overview to identify where more research is needed and assess its priority. The limitations of the available literature due to the lack of evidence for important outcomes and important populations, such as people with multimorbidity, should also be considered in practice and policy decisions."

                                "Acute otitis media (AOM) is a very common respiratory infection in early infancy and childhood. The marginal benefits of antibiotics for AOM in low-risk populations in general, the increasing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the huge estimated direct and indirect annual costs associated with otitis media (OM) have prompted a search for effective @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to prevent AOM. Objectives: To assess the effect of pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (PCVs) in preventing AOM in children up to 12 years of age. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 11), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1995 to November week 3, 2013), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1995 to December 2013), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (2007 to December 2013), LILACS (2007 to December 2013) and Web of Science (2007 to December 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of PCVs to prevent AOM in children aged 12 years or younger, with a follow-up of at least six months after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results: We included 11 publications of nine RCTs (n = 48,426 children, range 74 to 37,868 per study) of 7- to 11-valent PCV (with different carrier proteins). Five trials (n = 47,108) included infants, while four trials (n = 1318) included children aged one to seven years that were either healthy (one study, n = 264) or had a previous history of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), including AOM. We judged the methodological quality of the included studies to be moderate to high. There was considerable clinical diversity between studies in terms of study population, type of conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and outcome measures. We therefore refrained from pooling the results. In three studies, the 7-valent PCV with CRM197 as carrier protein (CRM197-PCV7) administered during early infancy was associated with a relative risk reduction (RRR) of all-cause AOM ranging from -5% in high-risk children (95% confidence interval (CI) -25% to 12%) to 7% in low-risk children (95% CI 4% to 9%). Another 7-valent PCV with the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) serogroup B as carrier protein, administered in infancy, did not reduce overall AOM episodes, while a precursor 11-valent PCV with Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) protein D as carrier protein was associated with a RRR of all-cause AOM episodes of 34% (95% CI 21% to 44%). A 9-valent PCV (with CRM197 carrier protein) administered in healthy toddlers was associated with a RRR of (parent-reported) OM episodes of 17% (95% CI -2% to 33%). CRM197-PCV7 followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide @hit_startvaccination@hit_end administered after infancy in older children with a history of AOM showed no beneficial effect on first occurrence and later AOM episodes. In a study in older children with a previously diagnosed respiratory tract infection, performed during the influenza season, a trivalent influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end combined with placebo (TIV/placebo) led to fewer all-cause AOM episodes than @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with TIV and PCV7 (TIV/PCV7) when compared to hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and placebo (HBV/placebo) (RRR 71%, 95% CI 30% to 88% versus RRR 57%, 95% CI 6% to 80%, respectively) indicating that CRM197-PCV7 after infancy may even have negative effects on AOM. Authors' conclusions: Based on current evidence of the effects of PCVs for preventing AOM, the licensed 7-valent CRM197-PCV7 has modest beneficial effects in healthy infants with a low baseline risk of AOM. Administering PCV7 in high-risk infants, after early infancy and in older children with a history of AOM, appears to have no benefit in preventing further episodes. Currently, several RCTs with different (newly licensed, multivalent) PCVs administered during early infancy are ongoing to establish their effects on AOM. Results of these studies may provide a better understanding of the role of the newly licensed, multivalent PCVs in preventing AOM. Also the impact on AOM of the carrier protein D, as used in certain pneumococcal @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, needs to be further established."

                                "Background: Different types of influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are currently produced worldwide. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end of pregnant women is recommended internationally, while healthy adults are targeted in North America. Objectives: To identify, retrieve and assess all studies evaluating the effects (efficacy, effectiveness and harm) of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against influenza in healthy adults, including pregnant women. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library 2013, Issue 2), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (January 1966 to May 2013) and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1990 to May 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with placebo or no intervention in naturally occurring influenza in healthy individuals aged 16 to 65 years. We also included comparative studies assessing serious and rare harms. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results: We included 90 reports containing 116 data sets; among these 69 were clinical trials of over 70,000 people, 27 were comparative cohort studies (about eight million people) and 20 were case-control studies (nearly 25,000 people). We retrieved 23 reports of the effectiveness and safety of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end administration in pregnant women (about 1.6 million mother-child couples). The overall effectiveness of parenteral inactivated @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against influenza-like illness (ILI) is limited, corresponding to a number needed to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end (NNV) of 40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26 to 128). The overall efficacy of inactivated @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in preventing confirmed influenza has a NNV of 71 (95% CI 64 to 80). The difference between these two values depends on the different incidence of ILI and confirmed influenza among the study populations: 15.6% of unvaccinated participants versus 9.9% of @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end participants developed ILI symptoms, whilst only 2.4% and 1.1%, respectively, developed laboratory-confirmed influenza. No RCTs assessing @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in pregnant women were found. The only evidence available comes from observational studies with modest methodological quality. On this basis, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end shows very limited effects: NNV 92 (95% CI 63 to 201) against ILI in pregnant women and NNV 27 (95% CI 18 to 185) against laboratory-confirmed influenza in newborns from @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end women. Live aerosol @hit_startvaccines@hit_end have an overall effectiveness corresponding to a NNV 46 (95% CI 29 to 115). The performance of one-dose or two-dose whole virion pandemic @hit_startvaccines@hit_end was higher, showing a NNV of 16 (95% CI 14 to 20) against ILI and a NNV of 35 (95% CI 33 to 47) against influenza, while a limited impact on hospitalisation was found (NNV 94, 95% CI 70 to 1022). @hit_startVaccination@hit_end had a modest effect on time offwork and had no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates. Inactivated @hit_startvaccines@hit_end caused local harms. No evidence of association with serious adverse events was found, but the harms evidence base was limited. The overall risk of bias in the included trials is unclear because it was not possible to assess the real impact of bias. Authors' conclusions: Influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end have a very modest effect in reducing influenza symptoms and working days lost in the general population, including pregnant women. No evidence of association between influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and serious adverse events was found in the comparative studies considered in the review. This review includes 90 studies, 24 of which (26.7%) were funded totally or partially by industry. Out of the 48 RCTs, 17 were industry-funded (35.4%)."
