                                "Background: Advances in high-throughput omics technologies allow us to quantify global cellular changes in DNA, RNA, proteins or metabolites under various experimental conditions or disease states. One active area of research is to develop methodology for integrating these large datasets to improve our mechanistic understanding and provide systems-level insights into cellular function. Furthermore, data integration can increase our statistical power as well as removing study bias. Here, we present NetworkAnalyst [1, 2], an interactive, webbased tool for biologists to perform complex @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end, visual data mining and data integration. Methods: There are two common approaches to data integration: (1) horizontal data integration, which combines different data sets from the same omic approach, such as performing @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of gene expression changes to identify expression signatures; and (2) vertical data integration, which seeks to coalesce different omic data sets, such as integrating transcriptomic and metabolomics data to identify perturbation in pathways of interest. To link these different datasets, NetworkAnalyst mines InnateDB [3] for curated protein-protein interactions (PPI) and creates biologically meaningful networks. Network topology @hit_startanalysis@hit_end can be used to identify those protein nodes that are highly connected (i.e. hubs), which can serve as useful biomarkers or therapeutic targets; while densely connected units (i.e. modules) that show strong differential expression patterns can be used to identify unique disease signatures. Results: Using NetworkAnalyst, we can generate novel hypotheses on various aspects of immune regulation, from neonatal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end response to common mis-regulation that contributes to inflammatory diseases such as asthma, Vasculitis and sepsis. For instance, we typically identify mis-regulated modules containing S100 protein family members in patients with inflammatory disorder. In patients who developed sepsis, we observed up-regulation in S100A8 and S100A9 genes and down-regulation in S100A4 gene [4]. A number of these S100 proteins have emerged as potential biomarkers in independent studies [5]. In contrast, we used NetworkAnalyst to overlay proteomic data onto transcriptomic networks to characterize neonatal response to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. We observed the up-regulation of a key immune hub, STAT1, in our transcriptome @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Independently, we identified known STAT1 PPI in our proteomic @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Together, our data suggest STAT1 may play an important role in @hit_startimmunization@hit_end response against viral @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Conclusions: Biological network @hit_startanalysis@hit_end is a powerful approach to study complex diseases, and can be an invaluable tool for biomarker discovery and the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions."

                                "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains one of the major healthcare problems globally. Pneumococcal disease is the leading cause of deaths among @hit_startvaccine@hit_end preventable diseases in children and adults. Plain polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end PPSV-23 and conjugated pneumnococcal polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end PCV-13 are widely used to prevent pneumococcal disease and CAP in adults without immunosuppression. The review concerns the results of trials and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of PPSV-23 and PCV-13 effectiveness in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and CAP prevention in immunocompetent adults. More and more expert @hit_startimmunization@hit_end committees in different countries are taking into consideration uncertain effectiveness of PPSV-23 in CAP prevention in immunocompetent adults, and recommend the PCV-13 priority use for mass @hit_startimmunization@hit_end campaigns in high-risk groups and elder population. Since the Russian Federation has started the PCV-13 @hit_startvaccination@hit_end campaign for early childhood only at the end of 2014, the anticipated serotype replacement should not be taken into consideration at the moment across all the age groups, and therefore the risk and age based approach to adult @hit_startvaccination@hit_end should be used with the PCV-13 priority."

                                "There have been many cases of the appearance of autoantibodies and symptoms of disease after exposure to adjuvants, not only after breast augmentation with silicone implants, but also as a very rare @hit_startvaccination@hit_end side effect, such as Gulf war syndrome or macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome. Diseases whose symptoms developed after such adjuvant exposure are called autoimmune/ in\udbc0\udfd0lammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). The group of adjuvants includes not only silicone implants, silica, squalen and aluminium, but also ink components used for making tattoos. @hit_startAnalyzing@hit_end the available reports on the in\udbc0\udfd0luence of adjuvants on the development of autoimmune diseases, the conclusion is that apart from long -term silicone exposure, the coexistence of other factors such as genetic or environmental is also necessary. @hit_startMetaanalyses@hit_end clearly do not con\udbc0\udfd0irm an increased risk of developing autoimmune disease after breast augmentation with silicone implants, or tattooing, but it seems that among these patients there is a group that is more predestined to develop disease symptoms. In the general population the bene\udbc0\udfd0its of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end are obvious, and the risk of severe adverse events following @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end is incomparably lower than the risk of developing a speci\udbc0\udfd0ic disease and its complications, also for patients with diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Because of data heterogeneity in previous studies and dif\udbc0\udfd0iculties in diagnosing ASIA it seems necessary to conduct further @hit_startanalyses@hit_end of adjuvants\u2019 in\udbc0\udfd0luence on autoimmune disease development, and to re\udbc0\udfd0ine ASIA diagnostic criteria, which now allow too easy a diagnosis of this syndrome."

                                "Background: Prenatal care is recommended during pregnancy as a method to improve neonatal and maternal outcomes. Improving the use of prenatal care is important, particularly for women at moderate to high risk of adverse outcomes. Incentives are sometimes utilized to encourage women to attend prenatal care visits. Objectives: To determine whether incentives are an effective tool to increase utilization of timely prenatal care among women. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2015) and the reference lists of all retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster-RCTs that utilized direct incentives to pregnant women explicitly linked to initiation and frequency of prenatal care were included. Incentives could include cash, vouchers, coupons or products not generally offered to women as a standard of prenatal care. Comparisons were to no incentives and to incentives not linked directly to utilization of care. We also planned to compare different types of interventions, i.e. monetary versus products or services. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results: We identified 11 studies (19 reports), six of which we excluded. Five studies, involving 11,935 pregnancies were included, but only 1893 pregnancies contributed data regarding our specified outcomes. Incentives in the studies included cash, gift card, baby carrier, baby blanket or taxicab voucher and were compared with no incentives. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was performed for only one outcome 'Return for postpartum care' and this outcome was not pre-specified in our protocol. Other @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were restricted to data from single studies. Trials were at a moderate risk of bias overall. Randomization and allocation were adequate and risk of selection bias was low in three studies and unclear in two studies. None of the studies were blinded to the participants. Blinding of outcome assessors was adequate in one study, but was limited or not described in the remaining four studies. Risk of attrition was deemed to be low in all studies that contributed data to the review. Two of the studies reported or @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end data in a manner that was not consistent with the predetermined protocol and thus were deemed to be at high risk. The other three studies were low risk for reporting bias. The largest two of the five studies comprising the majority of participants took place in rural, low-income, homogenously Hispanic communities in Central America. This setting introduces a number of confounding factors that may affect generalizability of these findings to ethnically and economically diverse urban communities in developed countries. The five included studies of incentive programs did not report any of this review's primary outcomes: preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, or perinatal death. In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, pregnant women receiving incentives were no more likely to initiate prenatal care (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.38, one study, 104 pregnancies). Pregnant women receiving incentives were more likely to attend prenatal visits on a frequent basis (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38, one study, 606 pregnancies) and obtain adequate prenatal care defined by number of \u201cprocedures\u201d such as testing blood sugar or blood pressure, @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end and counseling about breastfeeding and birth control (mean difference (MD) 5.84, 95% CI 1.88 to 9.80, one study, 892 pregnancies). In contrast, women who received incentives were more likely to deliver by cesarean section (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.30, one study, 979 pregnancies) compared to those women who did not receive incentives. Women who received incentives were no more likely to return for postpartum care based on results of @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.64, two studies, 833 pregnancies, Tau2 = 0.81, I2 = 98%). However, there was substantial heterogeneity in this @hit_startanalysis@hit_end so a subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end was performed and this identified a clear difference between subgroups based on the type of incentive being offered. In one study, women receiving non-cash incentives were more likely to return for postpartum care (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47, 240 pregnancies) than women who did not receive non-cash incentives. In another study, women receiving cash incentives were less likely to return for postpartum care (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62, 593 pregnancies) than women who did not receive cash incentives. No data were identified for the following secondary outcomes: frequency of prenatal care; pre-eclampsia; satisfaction with birth experience; maternal mortality; low birthweight (less than 2500 g); infant macrosomia (birthweight greater than 4000 g); or five-minute Apgar less than seven. Authors' conclusions: The included studies did not report on this review's main outcomes: preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, or perinatal death. There is limited evidence that incentives may increase utilization and quality of prenatal care, but may also increase cesarean rate. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to fully evaluate the impact of incentives on prenatal care initiation. There are conflicting data as to the impact of incentives on return for postpartum care. Two of the five studies which accounted for the majority of women in this review were conducted in rural, low-income, overwhelmingly Hispanic communities in Central America, thus limiting the external validity of these results. There is a need for high-quality RCTs to determine whether incentive program increase prenatal care use and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Incentive programs, in particular cash-based programs, as suggested in this review and in several observational studies may improve the frequency and ensure adequate quality of prenatal care. No peer-reviewed data have been made publicly available for one of the largest incentive-based prenatal programs - the statewide Medicaid-based programs within the United States. These observational data represent an important starting point for future research with significant implications for policy development and allocation of healthcare resources. The disparate findings related to attending postpartum care should also be further explored as the findings were limited by the number of studies. Future large RCTs are needed to focus on the outcomes of preterm birth, small-for-gestational age and perinatal outcomes."

                                "Background: Oral cancers are the sixth most common cancer worldwide, yet the prognosis following a diagnosis of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers remains poor, with approximately 50% survival at five years. Despite a sharp increase in research into molecularly targeted therapies and a rapid expansion in the number of clinical trials assessing new targeted therapies, their value for treating oral cancers is unclear. Therefore, it is important to summarise the evidence to determine the efficacy and toxicity of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for the treatment of these cancers. Objectives: To assess the effects of molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies, in addition to standard therapies, for the treatment of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers. Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 3 February 2015), @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, 2015, Issue 1), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end via Ovid (1946 to 3 February 2015) and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end via Ovid (1980 to 3 February 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (clinicaltrials.gov), the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference abstracts and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group clinical trials protocols for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx, and which compared targeted therapy or immunotherapy, plus standard therapy, with standard therapy alone. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where necessary. We combined sufficiently similar studies in @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end using random-effects models when there were at least four studies and fixed-effect models when fewer than four studies. We obtained or calculated a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary outcomes where possible. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. Main results: Twelve trials (2488 participants) satisfied the inclusion criteria. In the included trials, 12% of participants (298 participants) had tumours of the oral cavity and 59% (1468 participants) had oropharyngeal tumours. The remaining 29% had tumours of the larynx or hypopharynx and less than 1% had tumours at other sites. No included trial was at low risk of bias; seven had an unclear risk of bias, and five had a high risk of bias. We grouped trials by intervention type into three main comparisons: standard therapy plus epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (EGFR mAb) therapy (follow-up period 24 to 70 months); standard therapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (follow-up period 40 to 60 months) and standard therapy plus immunotherapy (follow-up period 24 to 70 months), all versus standard therapy alone. Moderate quality evidence showed that EGFR mAb therapy may result in 18% fewer deaths when added to standard therapy (HR of mortality 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.97; 1421 participants, three studies, 67% oropharyngeal tumours, 2% oral cavity tumours). There was also moderate quality evidence that EGFR mAb may result in 32% fewer locoregional failures when added to radiotherapy (RT) (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; 424 participants, one study, 60% oropharyngeal tumours). A subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end separating studies by type of standard therapy (radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT)) showed some evidence that adding EGFR mAb therapy to RT may result in a 30% reduction in the number of people whose disease progresses (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91; 424 participants, one study, 60% oropharyngeal tumours, unclear risk of bias). For the subgroup comparing EGFR mAb plus CRT with CRT alone there was insufficient evidence to determine whether adding EGFR mAb therapy to CRT impacts on progression-free survival (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 891 participants, one study, 70% oropharyngeal tumours, high risk of bias). The high subgroup heterogeneity meant that we were unable to pool these subgroups. There was evidence that adding cetuximab to standard therapy may result in increased skin toxicity and rash (RR 6.56; 95% CI 5.35 to 8.03; 1311 participants, two studies), but insufficient evidence to determine any difference in skin toxicity and rash in the case of nimotuzumab (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.31; 92 participants, one study). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether TKIs added to standard therapy impacts on overall survival (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.57; 271 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence), locoregional control (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.49; 271 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence), disease-free survival (HR 1.51; 95% CI 0.61 to 3.71; 60 participants, one study; very low quality evidence) or progression-free survival (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.28; 271 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence). We did find evidence of an increase in skin rash (erlotinib: RR 6.57; 95% CI 3.60 to 12.00; 191 participants, one study; lapatinib: RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.23 to 3.32; 67 participants, one study) and gastrointestinal complaints (lapatinib: RR 15.53; 95% CI 2.18 to 110.55; 67 participants, one study). We found very low quality evidence from one small trial that adding recombinant interleukin (rIL-2) to surgery may increase overall survival (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 201 participants, 62% oral cavity tumours, 38% oropharyngeal tumours) and there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rIL-2 impacts on adverse effects. Authors' conclusions: We found some evidence that adding EGFR mAb to standard therapy may increase overall survival, progression-free survival and locoregional control, while resulting in an increase in skin toxicity for some mAb (cetuximab). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether adding TKIs to standard therapies changes any of our primary outcomes. Very low quality evidence from a single study suggests that rIL-2 combined with surgery may increase overall survival compared with surgery alone."

                                "Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least four antenatal care (ANC) visits for all pregnant women. Almost half of pregnant women worldwide, and especially in developing countries do not receive this amount of care. Poor attendance of ANC is associated with delivery of low birthweight babies and more neonatal deaths. ANC may include education on nutrition, potential problems with pregnancy or childbirth, child care and prevention or detection of disease during pregnancy. This review focused on community-based interventions and health systems-related interventions. Objectives: To assess the effects of health system and community interventions for improving coverage of antenatal care and other perinatal health outcomes. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (7 June 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials. Trials of any interventions to improve ANC coverage were eligible for inclusion. Trials were also eligible if they targeted specific and related outcomes, such as maternal or perinatal death, but also reported ANC coverage. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results: We included 34 trials involving approximately 400,000 women. Some trials tested community-based interventions to improve uptake of antenatal care (media campaigns, education or financial incentives for pregnant women), while other trials looked at health systems interventions (home visits for pregnant women or equipment for clinics). Most trials took place in low-and middle-income countries, and 29 of the 34 trials used a cluster-randomised design. We assessed 30 of the 34 trials as of low or unclear overall risk of bias. Comparison 1: One intervention versus no intervention We found marginal improvements in ANC coverage of at least four visits (average odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.22; participants = 45,022; studies = 10; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.01; I2 = 52%; high quality evidence). Sensitivity @hit_startanalysis@hit_end with a more conservative intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) gave similar marginal results. Excluding one study at high risk of bias shifted the marginal pooled estimate towards no effect. There was no effect on pregnancy-related deaths (average OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.08; participants = 114,930; studies = 10; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.00; I2 = 0%; low quality evidence), perinatal mortality (average OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; studies = 15; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.01; I2 = 58%; moderate quality evidence) or low birthweight (average OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.00; I2 = 5%; high quality evidence). Single interventions led to marginal improvements in the number of women who delivered in health facilities (average OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15; studies = 10; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.00; I2 = 0%; high quality evidence), and in the proportion of women who had at least one ANC visit (average OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.79; studies = six; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.24; I2 = 76%; moderate quality evidence). Results for ANC coverage (at least four and at least one visit) and for perinatal mortality had substantial statistical heterogeneity. Single interventions did not improve the proportion of women receiving tetanus protection (average OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; studies = 8; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.01; I2 = 57%). No study reported onintermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria. Comparison 2: Two or more interventions versus no intervention We found no improvements in ANC coverage of four or more visits (average OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.21; participants = 7840; studies = six; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.10; I2 = 48%; low quality evidence) or pregnancy-related deaths (average OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.26; participants = 13,756; studies = three; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.00; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). However, combined interventions led to improvements in ANC coverage of at least one visit (average OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.17; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.00; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence), perinatal mortality (average OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.95; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.06; I2 = 83%; moderate quality evidence) and low birthweight (average OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.00; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end for both ANC coverage four or more visits and perinatal mortality had substantial statistical heterogeneity. Combined interventions improved the proportion of women who had tetanus protection (average OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.87; studies = 3; Heterogeneity: Tau2 = 0.01; I2 = 33%). No trial in this comparison reported on intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria. Comparison 3: Two interventions compared head to head. No trials found. Comparison 4: One intervention versus a combination of interventions There was no difference in ANC coverage (four or more visits and at least one visit), pregnancy-related deaths, deliveries in a health facility or perinatal mortality. No trials in this comparison reported on low birthweight orintermittent prophylactic treatment of malaria. Authors' conclusions: Implications for practice -Single interventions may improve ANC coverage (at least one visit and four or more visits) and deliveries in health facilities. Combined interventions may improve ANC coverage (at least one visit), reduce perinatal mortality and reduce the occurrence of low birthweight. The effects of the interventions are unrelated to whether they are community or health system interventions. Implications for research -More details should be provided in reporting numbers of events, group totals and the ICCs used to adjust for cluster effects. Outcomes should be reported uniformly so that they are comparable to commonly-used population indicators. We recommend further cluster-RCTs of pregnant women and women in their reproductive years, using combinations of interventions and looking at outcomes that are important to pregnant women, such as maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, alongside the explanatory outcomes along the pathway of care: ANC coverage, the services provided during ANC and deliveries in health facilities."

                                "Objective: To identify and quantify the adverse effects associated with the recombinant human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in adolescents. Data source: @hit_startSystematic review@hit_end of randomized clinical trials from @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, SciELO and Lilacs databases. Articles investigating the safety of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in subjects under 18 years and comparing the recombinant human papillomavirus types 6,11,16 and 18 @hit_startvaccine@hit_end with a control group were included. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end were performed for the outcomes of pain, erythema, swelling and fever, using clinical trials with maximum Jadad score. Data synthesis: Fourteen studies were included. The most common adverse effects related to the human papillomavirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end were effects with no severity (pain, erythema, edema, and fever). Five studies were used for the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end: pain-risk difference (RD)=11% (p<0.001); edema-RD=8% (p<0.001); erythema-RD=5% (p<0.001); fever-RD=2% (p<0.003). Conclusions: The recombinant human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16 and 18 @hit_startvaccine@hit_end was safe and well tolerated. The main adverse effects related to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were pain, erythema, edema and fever. The low frequency of severe adverse effects encourages the administration of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in the population at risk."

                                "Background: Control of rubella is desired because infection in early pregnancy can result in miscarriage, foetal death or congenital abnormality. Primary studies examining the effectiveness of immunoglobulins for post-exposure prophylaxis of rubella have small sample sizes and varying results. National public health recommendations suggest a degree of effectiveness. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion of polyclonal immunoglobulins of human sera or plasma origin for preventing rubella and congenital rubella syndrome when administered to exposed susceptible people before the onset of disease. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1946 to August week 2, 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to August 2014), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (1981 to August 2014), LILACS (1982 to August 2014) and Web of Science (1955 to August 2014). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry on 16 October 2014. We searched the reference lists of relevant retrieved reviews and studies and identified national public health guidelines. Selection criteria: For the outcome 'preventing cases of rubella', we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. We found several studies addressing this outcome where the design was a controlled clinical trial (CCT) (with exposure to rubella virus controlled by the investigators) but the method of allocation of participants to groups was not reported. We found an alternative report of one of these studies that indicated participants were assigned to groups randomly. We therefore included such studies as meeting criteria for RCTs or quasi-RCTs and undertook sensitivity @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. For the outcomes, 'congenital rubella infection' and 'congenital rubella syndrome', we included RCTs, quasi-RCTs and prospective controlled (cohort) studies. Participants were necessarily susceptible and exposed to rubella. Polyclonal immunoglobulins derived from human sera or plasma must have been administered intramuscularly or intravenously as the only intervention in at least one group. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Collaboration. Main results: We included 12 studies (430 participants) in the review: seven RCTs and five CCTs where it was not clear whether participants were randomly allocated to groups. We did not include any unpublished studies. Participants included children and adults of both sexes. Only one study included pregnant women. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. The quality of the 11 studies in the initial @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was moderate, although we classified no study as having a low risk of bias on all criteria. We included 11 studies in the initial @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of gamma-globulin (concentrated polyclonal immunoglobulins) versus control (saline or no treatment) for rubella cases. The result favoured the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.83) but was heterogenous (Chi2 test = 36.59, df = 10 (P value < 0.0001); I2 statistic = 73%). Heterogeneity was explained by subgrouping studies according to the estimated volume of gamma-globulin administered per pound of bodyweight and then removing those studies where the intervention was administered more than five days after participant exposure to rubella (post hoc @hit_startanalysis@hit_end). The test of subgroup differences demonstrated heterogeneity between subgroups according to our protocol definition (P value < 0.1; I2 statistic > 60%) and there appeared to be greater effectiveness of the intervention when a greater volume of gamma-globulin was administered ('0.027 to 0.037 ml/lb' RR 1.60 (95% CI 0.57 to 4.52); '0.1 to 0.15 ml/lb' RR 0.53 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.99); '0.2 to 0.5 ml/lb' RR 0.20 (95% CI 0.04 to 1.00)). None of the studies reported the outcome 'congenital rubella infection'. One included study reported on congenital rubella syndrome, with no cases among participants who were fewer than nine weeks pregnant at enrolment and who were randomised to one of two gamma-globulin groups ('high' or 'low' rubella titre). However, the study did not report how congenital rubella syndrome was measured and did not report the length of follow-up according to intervention group. This study did not include a non-treatment group. No included study measured adverse events. Authors' conclusions: Compared to no treatment, polyclonal immunoglobulins seem to be of benefit for preventing rubella. The available evidence suggests that this intervention may be of benefit up to five days after exposure, and that effectiveness is dependent on dose. Considering the attack rate for rubella cases in the control group of the highest volume gamma-globulin subgroup (333 per 1000), the absolute risk reduction (calculated from the RR) for this volume of gamma-globulin was 266 (95% CI 0 to 320) and the number needed to treat to benefit is four (95% CI 3 to incalculable). The included studies did not measure rubella-specific antibodies in the immunoglobulin products used in a standard way and thus estimation of the dose of rubella-specific antibodies in international units administered was not possible. As the concentration of rubella-specific antibodies in today's polyclonal immunoglobulin products may vary from those products used in the studies in the review, the volume required per pound of bodyweight to produce similar results may also vary. There is insufficient evidence to make direct conclusions about the effectiveness of polyclonal immunoglobulins for preventing congenital rubella syndrome. This is an area requiring further research."

                                "Background: During pregnancy, a Rhesus negative (Rh-negative) woman may develop antibodies when her fetus is Rhesus positive (Rh-positive). These antibodies may harm Rh-positive babies. Objectives: To assess the effects of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin on the incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation when given to Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised trials in Rh-negative women without anti-D antibodies given anti-D after 28 weeks of pregnancy, compared with no treatment, placebo or a different regimen of anti-D. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results: We included two trials involving over 4500 women, comparing anti-D prophylaxis with no anti-D during pregnancy in this review. Overall, the trials were judged to be at moderate to high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for pre-specified outcomes was also assessed using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. In regards to primary review outcomes, there did not appear to be a clear difference in the risks of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end when women who received anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks' gestation were compared with women who were not given antenatal anti-D: risk ratio (RR) for incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during pregnancy was 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.17, two trials, 3902 women; GRADE: low quality evidence); at birth of a Rh-positive infant the RR was 0.42 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.17, two trials, 2297 women); and within 12 months after birth of a Rh-positive infant the average RR was 0.39 (95% CI 0.10 to 1.62, two trials, 2048 women; Tau2: 0.47; I2: 39%; GRADE: low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation in subsequent pregnancies. Considering secondary outcomes, in one trial, women receiving anti-D during pregnancy were shown to be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test (which detects fetal cells in maternal blood) in pregnancy (at 32 to 25 weeks) (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88; 1884 women; GRADE: low quality evidence) and at the birth of a Rh-positive infant (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79; 1189 women; GRADE: low quality evidence). No clear differences were seen for neonatal jaundice (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.30; 1882 infants; GRADE: very low quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on adverse effects associated with anti-D treatment. Authors' conclusions: Existing studies do not provide conclusive evidence that the use of anti-D during pregnancy benefits either mother or baby in terms of incidence of Rhesus D alloimmunisation during the pregnancy or postpartum, or the incidence of neonatal morbidity (jaundice) (low to very low quality evidence). However women receiving anti-D may be less likely to register a positive Kleihauer test in pregnancy and at the birth of a Rh-positive infant (low quality evidence). Fewer women who receive anti-D during pregnancy may have Rhesus D antibodies in a subsequent pregnancy, with benefits for the baby, however this needs to be tested in studies of robust design."

                                "Background: This is an updated version of a review first published in theCochrane Database of @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end, Issue 4, in 2011. Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition of the vulval skin and its incidence is increasing in women under 50 years. High-grade VIN (also called usual-type VIN (uVIN) or VIN 2/3 or high-grade vulval intraepithelial lesion) is associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and may progress to vulval cancer, therefore is usually actively managed. There is no consensus on the optimal management of high-grade VIN; and the high morbidity and relapse rates associated with surgical interventions make less invasive interventions highly desirable. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medical (non-surgical) interventions for high-grade VIN. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library 2015, Issue 3), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (up to 30 March 2015). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed non-surgical interventions in women diagnosed with high-grade VIN. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used @hit_startCochrane@hit_end methodology with two review authors independently abstracting data and assessing risk of bias. Where possible, we synthesised data in @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end using random effects methods. Main results: Five trials involving 297 women with high-grade VIN (defined by trial investigators as VIN 2/3 or VIN 3 or 'high-grade' lesions) met our inclusion criteria: three trials assessed the effectiveness of topical imiquimod versus placebo; one assessed topical cidofovir versus topical imiquimod; and one assessed low- versus high-dose indole-3-carbinol in similar types of participants. Three trials were at a moderate to low risk of bias, two were at a potentially high risk of bias. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of the three trials comparing topical imiquimod 5% cream to placebo found that women in the active treatment group were more likely to show an overall response (complete and partial response) to treatment at five to six months compared with the placebo group (Risk Ratio (RR) 11.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.21 to 44.51; participants = 104; studies = 3; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%; high-quality evidence). A complete response at five to six months occurred in 36/62 (58%) and 0/42 (0%) participants in the active and placebo groups, respectively (RR 14.40, 95% CI 2.97 to 69.80; participants = 104; studies = 3; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%). A single trial reported 12-month follow-up, which revealed a sustained effect in overall response in favour of the active treatment arm at 12 months (RR 9.10, 95% CI 2.38 to 34.77; moderate-quality evidence), with 9/24 (38%) and 0/23 (0%) complete responses recorded in the active and placebo groups respectively. Progression to vulval cancer was also documented in this trial (one versus two participants in the active and placebo groups, respectively) and we assessed this evidence as low-quality. Only one trial reported adverse events, including erythema, erosion, pain and pruritis at the site of the lesion, which were more common in the imiquimod group. Dose reductions occurred more frequently in the active treatment group compared with the placebo group (19/47 versus 1/36 participants; RR 7.77, 95% CI 1.61 to 37.36; participants = 83; studies = 2; I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%; high-quality evidence). Only one trial reported quality of life (QoL) and there were no significant differences between the imiquimod and placebo groups. For the imiquimod versus cidofovir trial, 180 women contributed data. The overall response at six months was similar for the imiquimod and cidofovir treatment groups with 52/91 (57%) versus 55/89 (62%) participants responding, respectively (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18). A complete response occurred in 41 women in each group (45% and 46%, respectively; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37). Although not statistically different, total adverse events were slightly more common in the imiquimod group of this trial with slightly more discontinuations occurring in this group. Longer term response data from this trial are expected. The small trial comparing two doses of indole-3-carbinol contributed limited data. We identified five ongoing randomised trials of various interventions for VIN. Authors' conclusions: Topical imiquimod appears to be a safe and effective treatment for high-grade VIN (uVIN), even though local side-effects may necessitate dose reductions. However, longer term follow-up data are needed to corroborate the limited evidence that response to treatment is sustained, and to assess any effect on progression to vulval cancer. Available evidence suggests that topical cidofovir may be a good alternative to imiquimod; however, more evidence is needed, particularly regarding the relative effectiveness on longer term response and progression. We await the longer-term response data and the results of the five ongoing trials."
