                                "Objective To examine factors associated with parents' uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for their children. Design @hit_startSystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Data sources @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, AIDSLINE, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startPsycINFO@hit_end, Social Sciences Abstracts, Ovid @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, Scholars Portal, Social Sciences Citation Index and Dissertation Abstracts International from inception through November 2017. Methods We included studies that sampled parents and assessed uptake of HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for their children (\u226418 years) and/or sociodemographics, knowledge, attitudes or other factors associated with uptake. Study risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. We pooled data using random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end and conducted moderation @hit_startanalyses@hit_end to examine variance in uptake by sex of child and parent. Results Seventy-nine studies on 840 838 parents across 15 countries were included. The pooled proportion of parents' uptake of HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for their children was 41.5% (range: 0.7%-92.8%), twofold higher for girls (46.5%) than for boys (20.3%). In the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of 62 studies, physician recommendation (r=0.46 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.56)) had the greatest influence on parents' uptake, followed by HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end safety concerns (r=-0.31 (95% CI-0.41 to-0.16)), routine child preventive check-up, past 12 months (r=0.22 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.33)) and parents' belief in @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (r=0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.29)). Health insurance-covered HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (r=0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.29)) and lower out-of-pocket cost (r=-0.15 (95% CI-0.22 to-0.07)) had significant effects on uptake. We found significant moderator effects for sex of child. Conclusions Findings indicate suboptimal levels of HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake, twofold lower among boys, that may be improved by increasing physician recommendations, addressing parental safety concerns and promoting parents' positive beliefs about @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, in addition to expanding insurance coverage and reducing out-of-pocket costs. Limitations of this @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end include the lack of intervention studies and high risk of bias in most studies reviewed. Further studies should disaggregate HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake by sex of child and parent."

                                "Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic value of ki67 as a marker in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) treated with BCG. Methods Studies were systematically retrieved from the relevant databases (Web of Science, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end), and the expiry date was May 2017. The research steps referred to the Preferred Reporting Items for @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end and @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-Analysis@hit_end statement. Results: A total of 11 studies that complied with the inclusion criteria were included. The expression of ki67 was not statistically significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR 1.331; 95% CI 0.980 to 1.809). No significant heterogeneity was found among all included studies (I@sup_begin2@sup_end =36.7%, p=0.148). The expression of ki67 was statistically significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 2.567; 95% CI 1.562 to 4.219), and the overexpression of ki67 was the risk factor for PFS. Significant heterogeneity was noted among all the included studies (I@sup_begin2@sup_end =55.6%, p=0.021). The studies that might cause heterogeneity were excluded using the Galbraith plot, and then the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was performed again. The results showed that the expression of ki67 was still associated with PFS (HR 2.922; 95% CI 2.002 to 4.266). Conclusions: The overexpression of ki67 was the risk factor for PFS, and the relationship between the expression of ki67 and RFS was not statistically significant in patients with NMIBC treated with BCG intravesical immunotherapy. Well-designed, prospective, with a large sample size are still needed to validate the findings."

                                "In the UK, community pharmacies are more accessible to the general population than general practices. Therefore, government white papers and briefing documents from pharmacy professional bodies have advocated the expansion of the role of community pharmacists, particularly in relation to the provision of services that contribute to disease prevention and health improvement. It is unknown whether the same evidence exists globally for the expansion of these roles. This article attempts to appraise and summarise the global evidence for the public health roles that community pharmacists play. Barriers, as well as strategies that can enhance these roles, are also discussed. Electronic databases were searched to retrieve relevant literature published since 1 January 2000. The selected literature included 2 @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end, 7 @hit_startliterature reviews@hit_end, 23 interventional studies and 41 descriptive studies. These were assessed according to health topics (i.e. smoking cessation, weight management, health promotion, disease screening and preventive activities, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end, alcohol dependence advice and drug misuse, emergency hormonal contraception, and sexual health services). The effectiveness of community pharmacy-based public health interventions was shown in smoking cessation, health promotion, disease screening and preventive activities, provision of emergency hormonal contraceptive, and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end services. Although there was mixed evidence with respect to weight management and alcohol dependence advice interventions, the available data suggest feasibility and acceptability of these services due to the perceived ease of access and convenience."

                                "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in prisons can result in serious morbidity and death. We reviewed rates and risk factors for MRSA infection in custody, searching @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end databases. Between 1997 and 2015, 17 studies reported MRSA skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), with four case reports of MRSA non-SSTI (necrotizing pneumonias, brain abscess, and epiduritis). Significant associations with MRSA SSTI were found: MRSA colonization, previous skin infection, sharing soap or personal items, SSTI presenting as an abscess or furuncle, younger age, non-Caucasian, overweight, communal laundering, infrequent handwashing, lower hygiene score. RECOMMENDATIONS: early identification, isolation, and treatment of skin infections at admission; education on maintaining skin integrity and presenting early with skin infections; increasing hygiene by not sharing items and encouraging handwashing; improved handling and disinfection of communal laundering; influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for all prisoners and staff; and population-based longitudinal studies including younger detainees."

Especially, there was an increase in Human Papillomavirus-related head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Despite their increasing incidence in HIV-positive people, mechanisms that lead to their development and progression are only partially understood. The aim of this review is to identify key data and factors about HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in HIV-seropositive patients. Systematic search and review of the relevant @hit_startliterature@hit_end-peer-@hit_startreviewed@hit_end and grey-was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end and @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end (PRISMA) guidelines. We included in our review only the 35 full-text articles we considered the most substantial. It is mandatory to improve our knowledge about the interactions existing between HPV and HIV, and about their actions on oral mucosa immune system."

                                "Purpose: To summarize the current evidence on preventive services utilization in cancer survivors. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted in February 2016. Studies were included if they compared the utilization of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, cholesterol/lipid testing, bone densitometry, or blood pressure measurement among survivors of adulthood cancer to cancer-free controls. Random effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end were conducted to pool estimates. Results: Literature search identified 3740 studies of which 10 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Cancer survivors were significantly more likely to utilize bone densitometry (OR=1.226, 95% CI: 1.114 \u2013 1.350, p<0.001) and influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (OR=1.565, 95% CI: 1.176 \u2013 2.082, p=0.002) than cancer-free controls. No statistically significant differences were detected for blood pressure measurement and cholesterol/lipid testing (OR=1.322, 95% CI: 0.812 \u2013 2.151, p=0.261; OR=1.046, 95% CI: 0.96 \u2013 1.139, p=0.304). Conclusions: Cancer survivors were more likely to receive influenza @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end and bone densitometry. Future studies should evaluate underlying mechanisms and whether the utilization of preventive services translates into prolonged survival of cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Our @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end demonstrated cancer survivors to be more likely to receive the preventive services such as influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and bone densitometry than cancer free controls. Still, these results should be interpreted in the context of suboptimal utilization of preventive services in general, and for cancer survivors in specific. Future research should evaluate the underlying mechanisms and whether utilization of preventive services is associated with overall survival in cancer survivors."

                                "Widespread administration of oral poliovirus @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (OPV) has decreased global incidence of poliomyelitis by \u224899.9%. However, the emergence of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-derived@hit_end polioviruses (VDPVs) is threatening polio-eradication program. Primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients are at higher risks of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-associated@hit_end paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and prolonged excretion of immunodeficiency-associated VDPV (iVDPV). We searched @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startMedline@hit_end, Science direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and CDC and WHO databases by 30 September 2016, for all reports of iVDPV cases. Patient-level data were extracted form eligible studies. Data on @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage and income-level of countries were extracted from WHO/UNICEF and the WORLD BANK databases, respectively. We assessed bivariate associations between immunological, clinical, and virological parameters, and exploited multivariable modeling to identify independent determinants of poliovirus evolution and patients\u2019 outcomes. Study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016052931). 4329 duplicate-removed titles were screened. A total of 107 iVDPV cases were identified from 68 eligible articles. The majority of cases were from higher income countries with high polio-@hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage. 74 (69.81%) patients developed VAPP. Combined immunodeficiency patients showed lower rates of VAPP (p <.001) and infection clearance (p =.02), compared to humoral immunodeficiency patients. The rate of poliovirus genomic evolution was higher at early stages of replication, decreasing over time until reaching a steady state. Independent of replication duration, higher extent (p =.04) and rates (p =.03) of genome divergence contributed to a less likelihood of virus clearance. PID type (p <.001), VAPP occurrence (p =.008), and income-level of country (p =.04) independently influenced patients\u2019 survival. With the use of OPV, new iVDPVs will emerge independent of the rate of @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage. Inherent features of PIDs contribute to the clinical course of iVDPV infection and virus evolution. This finding could shed further light on poliomyelitis pathogenesis and iVDPV evolution pattern. It also has implications for public health, the polio eradication effort and the development of effective antiviral interventions."

                                "BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide; low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected. Economic evaluations are a useful decision tool to assess costs versus benefits of hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening. No published study reviewing economic evaluations of HBV screening in LMICs has been undertaken to date.",
                                "METHODS: The following databases were searched from inception to 21 April 2017: @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end Plus, the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, Global Health and the Cost-effectiveness @hit_startAnalysis@hit_end Registry. English-language studies were included if they assessed the costs against the benefits of HBV screening in LMICs. PROSPERO registration: CRD42015024391, 20 July 2015.",
                                "RESULTS: Nine studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. One study from Thailand indicated that adding hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) to HBV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for newborns following screening of pregnant women might be cost-effective for some LMICs, though inadequate total funding and health infrastructure were likely to limit feasibility. A similar study from China indicated a benefit to cost ratio of 2.7 from selective HBIG administration to newborns, if benefits were considered from a societal perspective. Of the two studies assessing screening amongst the general adult population, a single cost-benefit @hit_startanalysis@hit_end from China found a benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of 1.73 with @hit_startvaccination@hit_end guided by HBV screening of adults aged 21-39, compared to 1.42 with @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with no screening, both from a societal perspective. Community-based screening of adults in The Gambia with linkage to treatment yielded an incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year averted of $566 (in 2017 USD), less than two-times gross domestic product per capita for that country.",
                                "CONCLUSIONS: Screening with 'catch-up' @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for younger adults yielded benefits above costs, and screening linked with treatment has shown cost-effectiveness that may be affordable for some LMICs. However, interpretation needs to account for total cost implications and further research in LMICs is warranted as there were only nine included studies and evidence from high-income countries is not always directly applicable."

We performed a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or prospective observational cohorts reporting associations of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (IV) and/or pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (PV) with IS. We identified a total of 12 studies (543,311 patients; 47.4% @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end). @hit_startVaccination@hit_end was not related to the risk of IS (RR = 1.06, 95%CI: 0.74\u20131.51, p = 0.77), with no significant differences (p = 0.26) among RCTs (RR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.30\u20131.47) and observational studies (RR = 1.11, 95%CI: 0.76\u20131.61). Evidence of considerable heterogeneity was identified within observational studies (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 98%), but not within RCTs (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%). In subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end according to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end type, IV was associated with a significantly lower risk of IS (RR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.79\u20130.96, p = 0.004) with moderate evidence of heterogeneity (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 53%). No association was seen for PV (RR = 1.38, 95%CI: 0.60\u20133.16, p = 0.45), where considerable heterogeneity was identified (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 97%). In the additional adjusted @hit_startanalyses@hit_end of observational studies, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end tended to be associated with lower risk of IS (HRadjusted = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.75\u20131.01; p = 0.07). The findings of this @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end indicate that IV may be associated with a lower risk of IS. This association was not reproduced for PV or the combination of two @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Substantial heterogeneity was detected across observational studies for all outcome events, while moderate to low heterogeneity was identified across included RCTs. These preliminary findings require independent validation in large RCTs."

                                "Background: The anti-hepatitis B @hit_startimmunization@hit_end campaigns launched in the early 1990s were a major public health breakthrough and targeted various populations (at-risk adults, newborns, adolescents). However, debate is still active about a possible link between this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and central demyelination. This study provides a pooled estimate of this risk based on a comprehensive review and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of all available epidemiologic studies. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was conducted in @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, ISI Web of Science and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library from database inception to 10 May 2017. Grey literature was searched and snowballing was also undertaken. Only observational studies including a control group were retained. Primary outcome was multiple sclerosis diagnosed by recognized criteria. Study selection was performed by two independent reviewers with disagreements solved through discussion. This @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end based on crude, adjusted estimates, or risks limited to the 3 months following @hit_startimmunization@hit_end was performed using a generic inverse variance random-effect model. Heterogeneity was investigated; sensitivity and subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end were performed when necessary. This study followed the PRISMA statement and the MOOSE reporting guideline (Study protocol registered in PROSPERO: CRD42015020808). Findings: Of the 2804 references reviewed, 13 studies with a control group were @hit_startanalysed@hit_end. None of the pooled risk estimates for either multiple sclerosis or central demyelination following HB @hit_startimmunization@hit_end reached statistical significance. When considering adjusted risk ratios, the following non-significant figures were obtained: 1.19 (95%CI: 0.93 \u2013 1.52) and 1.25 (95%CI: 0.97 \u2013 1.62), for multiple sclerosis and central demyelination, respectively. Conclusions: No evidence of an association between hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and central demyelination was found."
