                                "Introduction: Hepatitis A, caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), is primarily transmitted via the fecal/oral route either through ingestion of contaminated food and water or through direct contact with an infectious person. Prevalence of hepatitis A is strongly correlated with socioeconomic factors, decreasing with increased socio-economic development, access to clean water and sanitation. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end against HAV should be part of a comprehensive plan for the prevention and control of viral hepatitis, either as part of regular childhood @hit_startimmunization@hit_end programs or with other recommended @hit_startvaccines@hit_end for travelers. Areas covered: We present here evidence for the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated HAV pediatric @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (Avaxim\u00ae 80U Pediatric, Sanofi Pasteur), indicated for use in children aged 12 months to 15 years. Data evaluated are from trials undertaken during the clinical development of this @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end and post-market pharmacovigilance. Expert opinion: The pediatric HAV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is highly immunogenic and generates long-lasting protection against hepatitis A disease in children. The safety and immunogenicity data presented in this review suggest that the pediatric HAV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is a valuable option in the prevention of HAV infection in children in many areas of the world where the disease remains a healthcare issue."

                                "Lyme disease (LD) is an infection transferred to humans through bites from infected ticks. Surveillance indicates that the number of LD cases is increasing in the UK, therefore, improved knowledge about reducing transmission from ticks to humans is needed. Eighteen electronic databases were searched and additional web-based searching was conducted, to locate empirical research, published from 2002 onwards. Sixteen studies that evaluated five types of prevention intervention were included: personal protection (n = 4), domestic strategies (landscape modification and chemical pest control) (n = 3), education (n = 6), @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (n = 3), and deer-reduction programmes (n = 2). In general the quality of evidence was low. Results suggest that personal protection strategies, including the use of tick repellents and wearing of protective clothes, can prevent tick bites and reduce the incidence of LD among adults. Educational interventions were generally successful for improving adults\u2019 knowledge, behavioural beliefs (e.g., self-efficacy for performing tick checks) and preventative behaviour, but for children, the findings were mixed. For adults and children, knowledge changes did not typically translate into a lower incidence of LD. Whilst evidence on @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against LD is promising, too few studies were available to reach robust conclusions. There was no evidence of effectiveness for deer culling, and the evidence was inconclusive for applying acaricide (tick poison) to deer's ears and heads. Low-quality evidence suggests that personal protective strategies, that limit exposure to ticks, should continue to be recommended, as should education to encourage the adoption of personal protective strategies; further investigation of education interventions for children, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and deer programmes is needed."

                                "Background: Many studies concentrated on the relationships between different types of family history and stroke, but they have not arrived at an unified conclusion. We conducted a comprehensive @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end to further evaluate the associations. Methods: Different databases were searched for related studies published from 1990 to August 2017. The relative risk was considered as the common measure of association across different studies. Heterogeneity of effects across studies was quantified by I@sup_begin2@sup_end. Results: Sixteen published studies (total participants: 655,552) were eligible in this study. The pooled multifactorial adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 1.40 (1.18, 1.67) for individuals with paternal history, 1.36 (1.20, 1.53) for those with maternal history, and 1.44 (1.17, 1.77) for those with sibling history. Based on cohort studies, the pooled adjusted RRs (95%CIs) for paternal, maternal, and sibling history were 1.33 (1.11-1.59), 1.28 (1.14-1.45), and 1.24 (1.01-1.51), respectively, all of which were smaller than those based on case-control and cross-sectional studies. In studies with large sample size, the respective adjusted RR (95%CI) of stroke for paternal, maternal, and sibling history was 1.30 (1.09, 1.56), 1.30 (1.18, 1.44), and 1.26 (1.02, 1.56), which was lower than that in studies with small sample size. Conclusions: Each type of family history of stroke was associated with an increased stroke risk. We could not find significant differences among stroke risks relating to different types of family history of stroke. Thus, paternal, maternal, and sibling history require our equal attention in the stroke prevention and control work."

                                "Background: The Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca is one of the world's largest annual mass gatherings. Inevitable overcrowding during the pilgrims' stay greatly increases the risk of acquiring and spreading infectious diseases, especially respiratory diseases. Method: The @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end/@hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Scopus databases were searched for all relevant papers published prior to February 2018 that evaluated the prevalence of clinical symptoms of respiratory infections, including pneumonia, among Hajj pilgrims, as well as their influenza and pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end status. Results: A total of 61 papers were included in the review. Both cohort- and hospital-based studies provide complementary data, and both are therefore necessary to provide a complete picture of the total burden of respiratory diseases during the Hajj. Respiratory symptoms have been common among Hajj pilgrims over the last 15 years. In cohorts of pilgrims, cough ranged from 1.9% to 91.5%. However, the prevalence rates of the most common symptoms (cough, sore throat, and subjective fever) of influenza-like illness (ILI) varied widely across the included studies. These studies have shown variable results, with overall rates of ILI ranging from 8% to 78.2%. These differences might result from differences in study design, study period, and rates of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end against seasonal influenza that ranged from 1.1% to 100% among study participants. Moreover, the definition of ILI was inconsistent across studies. In hospitalized Hajj pilgrims, the prevalence of pneumonia, that remains a major concern in critically ill patients, ranged from 0.2% to 54.8%. Conclusions: Large multinational follow-up studies are recommended for clinic-based syndromic surveillance, in conjunction with microbiological surveillance. Matched cohorts ensure better comparability across studies. However, study design and data collection procedures should be standardized to facilitate reporting and to achieve comparability between studies. Furthermore, the definition of ILI, and of most common symptoms used to define respiratory infections (e.g., upper respiratory tract infection), need to be precisely defined and consistently used. Future studies need to address potential effect of influenza and pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in the context of the Hajj pilgrimage."

                                "Objectives: @hit_startCochrane systematic reviews@hit_end require more methodological support from @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Review Groups (CRGs) than is customarily received by authors from journals; CRGs must therefore prioritize reviews to conserve resources. The TRIP database provided a data set of questions to guide prioritization for the acute respiratory infections (ARIs) CRG. Study Design and Setting: We extracted the ARI searches from the TRIP database (2010 to 2017) that contained at least one disease and one clinical management term, (defined as a \u201csearch\u201d), and tabulated these by frequency. Results: There were 314,346 ARI searches from which we inferred 45,497 clinical questions, covering 365 topics. Two-thirds (30,541) of these addressed 20 clinical questions, of which treatment were the most frequent, followed by diagnosis, mortality, and prognosis. The five most frequent clinical questions were \u201cInfluenza + @hit_startVaccination@hit_end\u201d 4,989 (12.1%), \u201cacute otitis media + antibiotics\u201d 3,578 (8.7%), \u201ccommon cold + vitamin C\u201d 3,528 (8.6%), \u201cmeningitis + corticosteroids\u201d 1,910 (4.6%), and \u201cpneumonia + general treatment\u201d 1,765 (4.3%). The 20 most frequent clinical questions were addressed by @hit_startCochrane@hit_end reviews or protocols. Conclusion: ARI questions are common and repeated often. Most may have been addressed by @hit_startCochrane@hit_end reviews. The remainder form the basis of a priority list to assign resources for future @hit_startCochrane@hit_end topics."

Data synthesis: In the last 15 years, new non-invasive markers have been investigated to characterize environmental enteric dysfunction; however, the best tests to be used have not yet been identified. There is evidence that, in environmental enteric dysfunction, a systemic inflammatory process may also occur as a consequence of increased intestinal permeability, in addition to intestinal mucosa abnormalities. Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and changes in fecal microbiota profile have also been identified. There is evidence indicating that environmental enteric dysfunction can impair not only full growth but also the neuropsychomotor development and response to orally administered @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. It is important to emphasize that the environmental enteric dysfunction is not a justification for not carrying out @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, which must follow the regular schedule. Another aspect to emphasize is the greater risk for those children who had height impairment in early childhood, possibly associated with environmental enteric dysfunction, to present overweight and obesity in adulthood when exposed to a high calorie diet, which has been called \u201ctriple burden.\u201d Conclusions: According to the @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end evidence, the control of environmental enteric dysfunction is very important for the full expression of growth, development, and @hit_startvaccine@hit_end response in the pediatric age group."

                                "Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological profile of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Brazil, the first Latin American country to introduce the group C meningococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (included in the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedule in 2010). Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was conducted, covering the years 2005\u20132017, to identify epidemiological information on IMD and Neisseria meningitidis carriers in Brazil. Documents from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and two public databases were @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end to determine annual incidence rates, absolute numbers of diagnosed cases, serogroups identified, the relative distribution of cases per serogroup, and the case fatality rate (CFR). Results: Sixteen studies were selected. The incidence rate ranged from 0.88 to 5.3 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year. According to secondary data, the annual incidence of IMD in 2015 was highest in males <1 year old (7.1/100 000). The number of diagnosed cases declined significantly over the years. In the literature, IMD showed a CFR from 20.0% to 50.0%, and a higher CFR for serogroup W (17.8%). Secondary data showed an absolute reduction in meningitis-attributable deaths between 2007 and 2015; however, the CFR remained stable (11.1% in 2007 and 8.4% in 2015). In 2015, serogroup W showed the highest CFR (24.1%), followed by serogroups C (19.2%), B (17.7%), and Y (14.3%). Conclusions: Despite a reduction in cases, the CFR remained stable and similar in the different age groups, even for disease caused by different serogroups. The highest CFR was found to be associated with serogroup W."

                                "The immunogenicity and efficacy of Fasciola DNA @hit_startvaccines@hit_end have not yet been comprehensively summarised in the form of a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Though multiple @hit_startvaccine@hit_end studies with respect to Fasciola @hit_startvaccines@hit_end exist, the variance in the experimental parameters has made comparison difficult. We conducted a bibliographic database search in Scopus, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Science Direct, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end and Web of Science databases, limited to publications from 1998 to 2017. The key words: Liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, Fasciola gigantica, DNA @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, and immunogenicity were used in combination to form search strings. A total of 4760 studies were identified after initial screening, of which 14 qualified for @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and 7 for @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. The mean Odds Ratio (OR) for all studies was 0.565 (95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.293 to 1.087), which means the percentage of protection in terms of decreased fluke burden in animals @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end with DNA @hit_startvaccines@hit_end was 43.5%. A moderate protective efficacy was observed for cysteine protease and phosphoglycerate kinase @hit_startvaccine@hit_end antigen candidates (pooled OR and 95% CI, [0.542; 0.179\u20131.721] and [0.616; 0.219\u20131.735], respectively). @hit_startVaccine@hit_end effectiveness was observed in individual studies and cohorts; however, the overall pooled efficacy for all @hit_startvaccine@hit_end candidates was found to be non-significant. Despite multiple individual studies showing promising results for various DNA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end candidates against fascioliasis, the pooled studies showed the non-significant effect of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end formulations against fluke burden, and displayed minimal protective efficacy against Fasciola infection. Though promising results are observed in isolated studies, further animal trials with standardised experimental parameters are required to develop new @hit_startvaccine@hit_end candidates effective against Fasciola."

                                "Introduction: Despite improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease in the elderly population, it remains the largest single cause of disability and the second leading cause of death in the world. Effectively preventing cardiovascular disease may be the best approach for reducing the burden of stroke in elderly patients. Geriatric psychiatrists often face the challenge of managing patients with major neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs) presenting with behavior disturbances and requiring psychopharmacological intervention. In those elderly patients with MNCD and psychosis who are treated with antipsychotic medication (AP), there is concern that cardiovascular adverse event (CVAE) risks are likely to be compounded. Stroke is a life-changing event that affects not only stroke patients themselves but their family members, caregivers, and the health care system. Relatively little is known about CVAE prevention in elderly patients with MNCD, as this group has often been excluded from interventional studies. Clinicians need to be cautious when extrapolating the results of clinical trials in patients without MNCD. The aim of this review is to summarize the current scientific knowledge about stroke prevention in elderly patients with MNCD with behavioral disturbances who are on antipsychotics. Management strategies for reducing stroke risk in patients with MNCD and psychosis when antipsychotic medications are necessary, were proposed based on patients evaluated on a geriatric psychiatry unit. Methods: @hit_startSystematic literature review@hit_end, case series. Results: Based on our @hit_startliterature review@hit_end and case series, the following daily practice strategies for the primary prevention of stroke in elderly with major neurocognitive disorder and psychosis who are taking antipsychotic medication include the following: Appropriate Health Education It is essential to educate elderly patients who are at risk of stroke, and their caregivers, to implement a heart-healthy diet and lifestyle with attention to a holistic approach to health care and stress management. Identifying and Implementing Appropriate Alternatives to the Use of AP Medication Determining alternatives to APs for treating psychosis in patients with MNCD start with careful evaluation and providing interventions for co-occurring physical, medical, psychiatric or psychosocial conditions that may trigger the behavioral disturbance. This is of tantamount importance and requires astute, persevering assessment of the patient and the system in which the patient resides and operates. A number of nonpharmacological interventions can be used to manage many of the non-cognitive signs and symptoms of MNCD, and these strategies should be attempted as first-line approaches. Other options include the use of other psychotropic drugs. No antipsychotics are approved in the United States for psychosis associated with dementia, although these drugs are commonly used in patients with MNCD and psychosis. Prioritizing Indications for the Use of AP Medication Patients with severe psychosis and agitation may be prioritized for treatment with APs if immediate patient or patient community safety is a concern and if the benefits from such treatment exceed the associated risks. Recent longitudinal research findings suggest that psychosis and agitation can lead to increased rates of mortality beyond that introduced by the APs themselves. Weighing the risks vs. benefits of treatment with APs can help guide whether this medication may be used to enhance well-being. A palliative approach, rather than a curative stance to treatment may be helpful when evaluating treatment for the purposes of wellbeing in many patients with MNCD, stroke and psychosis. Managing the Neurologic and Cardiovascular Stroke Risks Associated with AP Medication Use The following suggestions may provide some guidance in managing the neurologic and cardiovascular stroke risks associated with APs. 1. Start with low doses of APs and increase the dose gradually. Continue to monitor the patient's progress over time andconsider stopping some medications if the situation has changed. 2. Monitor the body mass index (BMI). 3. Monitor the glucose level to keep the HA1c level below 7.0 4. Maintain blood pressure at or below 140/90 without inducing hypotension. 5. Consider using low doses of aspirin as an antiplatelet treatment. 6. Provide anticoagulation treatment for those with atrial fibrillation. 7. Consider using statins, at high doses if appropriate, to keep the LDL level below 70 8. Provide smoke cessation assistance for those who smoke cigarettes. Encourage influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end as epidemiological and clinical trial evidence provides support that this can reduce the risk of vascular events, including stroke Managing AP Medication Related Metabolic Syndrome Which Can Increase Stroke Risk Monitoring BMI, blood glucose levels/HA1c and lipid levels on a regular basis and making lifestyle changes such as encouraging weight loss and engaging in modest exercise can be helpful. Conclusions: The CVAE risks of elderly with MNCD and psychosis who need AP is significant. This review illustrates how such risks may be managed through promoting a heart healthy diet and life style changes, identifying and implementing appropriate alternatives APs, prioritizing indications for the use of APs, managing the neurologic and cardiovascular stroke risks associated with APs, and managing AP medication related metabolic syndrome which can increase stroke risk.
