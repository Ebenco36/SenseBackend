The highest and the lowest proportion of N. meningitidis serogroups in invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) was for NmB with 48.5% (95% CI: 45–52) and NmX with 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3–1.7). Among the WHO regional offices, serogroup NmW with 57.5% (95% CI: 35–77.5) in Eastern Mediterranean, and NmZ with 0.1% (95% CI: 0–0.9) in America had the highest and the lowest proportion of N. meningitidis serogroups in IMD. NmC with 9.7% (95% CI: 5.6–16.2) and NmB with 9.5% (95% CI: 0.2–3.8) had the highest proportion in 1–4 and <1 year age groups, respectively. Our analysis showed that NmB had the highest proportion of N. meningitidis serogroups in IMD worldwide. However, proportion of N. meningitidis serogroups in IMD varied noticeably across countries and age groups. Therefore, establishing appropriate control guidelines depending on the geographical regions and age groups is essential for prevention of IMD.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsNeisseria meningitidisSerogroupMeta-analysisMeningococcal infectionsRecommended articlesCited by (0)View Abstract© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.Recommended articlesNo articles found.Article MetricsView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.
