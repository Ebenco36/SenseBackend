The policy of annual vaccination was adopted worldwide and continues to this day. In many countries, annual vaccination is still recommended only for high-risk individuals, but in North America the age criteria for annual vaccination has been incrementally expanded over the past two decades. In 2000, Ontario recommended universal annual influenza vaccination for all residents ≥6 months of age, and in 2010 the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices similarly recommended universal annual vaccination for all adults and children.\n",
    "Annual vaccination has been justified on the basis of influenza virus antigenic drift requiring periodic vaccine updates, and by the gradual decline in vaccine-induced antibody over time. In the US, life expectancy at birth is approximately 75 years for men and 80 years for women, and a child born in 2017 can therefore expect to receive 70–80 annual influenza vaccinations based on current recommendations. Despite this, the effects of repeated annual vaccination on individual long-term protection, population immunity, and virus evolution remain largely unknown.\n",
    "Signals of concern regarding potential negative effects of repeated vaccination were first raised four decades ago, and subsequent studies yielded inconclusive results.

    "===== 2.  Historical context =====\n",
    "2.1.  British boarding school outbreaks The earliest reports regarding potential negative effects of repeated annual vaccination were published in a series of three papers describing influenza outbreaks at a British boarding school from 1972 to 1976 when only A/H3N2 and type B viruses were circulating. The initial publication described a 3-year randomized clinical trial that began in October 1970 [ Citation 6 ]. Participating youth, 11–19 years old, were randomly assigned to receive a subcutaneous dose of whole virus inactivated vaccine containing either influenza A or B. For each of the subsequent two seasons, previously enrolled boys were revaccinated with the same A/Hong Kong/1/68 vaccine and new entrants were randomized. An influenza H3N2 outbreak caused by A/England/42/72 occurred in December 1972, and the authors reported no significant difference in the attack rate for boys who had received one, two, or three doses of vaccine. However, the attack rates were not reported for each group. A subsequent 1974 outbreak of A/Port Chalmers/1/73 demonstrated that vaccination in an earlier season can indirectly affect the risk of infection in a future season [ Citation 7 ]. The H3N2 attack rate in 1974 was significantly higher in boys who had previously received the A/Hong Kong vaccine in 1970–1972 compared with those who had not. The authors attributed this paradoxical finding of increased risk to the fact that ‘the A/Hong Kong vaccine, by reducing the proportion infected during the A/England outbreak, actually increased the proportion susceptible to attack during the subsequent outbreak of A/Port Chalmers’ (i.e. infection block hypothesis). However, even among boys uninfected in the 1972 outbreak, the attack rate in 1974 was still 50% higher in those who had previously received the A/Hong Kong vaccine (27/45, 60%) vs. the influenza B vaccine (11/26, 40%) ( p = .15). The third boarding school outbreak occurred in the spring of 1976 [ Citation 8 ]. The 1976 outbreak was caused by a new H3N2 antigenic cluster: A/Victoria/3/75. The investigators compared attack rates in 1976 for boys who had received the current A/Port Chalmers vaccine with no prior vaccination, those previously vaccinated, and unvaccinated boys. This analysis was restricted to 375 boys who attended school during all three outbreaks and was based on receipt of prior strains rather than number of vaccine doses. Accordingly, the total number of doses received in the ‘repeat vaccination’ group may have ranged from 3 to 5 ( Table 1 ). Table 1. Influenza A vaccines administered by season and year of matriculation at Christ’s Hospital Boarding School. Influenza A (H3N2) outbreaks occurred in December 1972, spring 1974, and spring 1976. Download CSV Display Table The attack rate among boys who received the A/Port Chalmers vaccine without prior vaccine doses was about 30% lower compared to boys who were completely unvaccinated ( Figure 1 ). Conversely, the attack rate was nearly 50% higher in those who had received all three influenza A vaccines: A/Port Chalmers + A/England + A/Hong Kong compared to the completely unvaccinated boys. The same patterns were observed among boys regardless of prior infection history during the first two outbreaks, suggesting that the infection block hypothesis does not explain all of the differences observed. However, the sample size was small in each vaccine group, and there were no statistically significant differences in attack rates across the three vaccine groups. Figure 1. Influenza A attack rates and vaccination status at a British boarding school during the 1976 outbreak. The analysis was restricted to students attending school during all three outbreaks. We estimated the attack rates for boys not previously infected (light gray bars) by recalculating the denominators after excluding ‘Cases 1972: A/England’ and ‘Cases 1974: A/Port Chalmers’ as shown in the original publication. The A/Port Chalmers/1/73 vaccine (‘A/PC’) was co-administered with A/England/42/72 for the 1974–75 season, and with A/Scotland/840/74 for the 1975–76 season. Data for this figure were derived from Figure 2 of reference [ Citation 8 ] and reprinted from The Lancet, Vol 313/Issue 8106, T.W. Hoskins, Joan R. Davies, A.J. Smith, Christine L. Miller, Audrey Allchin, Assessment of inactivated influenza-a vaccine after three outbreaks of influenza a at christ’s hospital/p33-35, 1979, with permission from Elsevier. Display full size Figure 2. Allocation into placebo and intervention arms for five year clinical trial of repeated vaccination (from reference [ Citation 9 ]); TIV = trivalent inactivated whole virus vaccine. Display full size The cumulative attack rate across all three outbreaks was similar among boys who were unvaccinated during the entire period (51%) and boys who were appropriately vaccinated before each outbreak (41%). These findings led the authors to question the net benefit of repeated annual vaccination: ‘These observations on three outbreaks of influenza A in a school suggest that annual revaccination with inactivated influenza A vaccine confers no long term advantage. The practice of offering annual revaccination to adults seems open to question.’\n",
    "2.2.  Repeated vaccination randomized trial The concern that repeated annual vaccination might reduce vaccine efficacy led the US National Institutes of Health to fund a 5-year randomized clinical trial. The trial was conducted from 1983 to 1988 and final results published in 1997 [ Citation 9 ]. Healthy 30–60 year-old adults were recruited to receive either licensed, trivalent inactivated whole virus vaccine (TIV, Connaught Laboratories) or placebo. Some, but not all, study participants were randomized. New study participants were randomly assigned to receive TIV or placebo only if they had not received influenza vaccine in the past 3 years (first vac group). Those who had been vaccinated in the past three years were assigned to the multiple vaccination (multivac) group and TIV was administered each fall for the duration of the study. As a result, the multivac group included both randomized and non-randomized individuals. Each fall, participants who had previously received placebo were re-randomized to receive vaccine (first vac group) or placebo ( Figure 2 ). Serum samples were collected pre- and post-vaccination and after each season to assess hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response to vaccine and epidemic strains. There was no active illness surveillance, but participants were encouraged to report respiratory illness episodes; nasal washes were obtained for virus isolation in cell culture. The study period included two predominant H1N1 seasons, two H3N2 seasons, and three type B seasons. Overall, the influenza infection rate (defined by seroconversion and/or virus isolation) was significantly lower for each influenza vaccine group (first vac or multivac) compared with the placebo group in 10 of 14 comparisons. In two of the remaining four comparisons, there was a lower infection rate in the vaccine group that was not statistically significant ( p = .07). These analyses included both randomized and non-randomized participants. In a series of logistic regression models restricted to randomized participants, influenza infection (virus isolation or seroconversion) was not associated with the number of sequential annual vaccinations. However, the majority of infections were identified based on seroconversion, which has been recognized as a source of bias since the 1940s by underestimating infections in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals [ Citation 10 , Citation 11 ]. This ‘antibody ceiling’ effect limits the serologic response among vaccinated individuals who develop influenza infection. In an analysis that was restricted to randomized participants and infections identified by virus isolation, the authors reported a significant association between number of vaccine doses and virus-confirmed infection during the H3N2 dominant 1987–1988 season (odds ratio = 1.48, p = .006). The incremental odds of virus detection with increasing doses were not linear, and the virus-confirmed attack rate in 1987–1988 among people who had received six vaccine doses was 2.7-fold higher compared to those who received placebo ( p = .07, chi-squared) ( Figure 3 ). In 1987–1988, the H3N2 vaccine strain was updated but antigenically similar to the prior season strain. Both the updated and previous H3N2 vaccine strains were mismatched to the 1987–1988 epidemic strain. During the same season there was a significant reduction in postvaccination geometric mean titer (GMT) against the epidemic strain with increasing number of sequential vaccinations ( p < .001). In contrast to 1987–1988, there was no association between number of vaccine doses and virus-confirmed influenza in the 1984–1985 season when the H3N2 vaccine strain was identical to the prior season and well-matched to the epidemic strain; none of the participants had received more than three cumulative vaccines doses in 1984–1985.

Display full size The authors concluded that the study results ‘provide reassuring evidence that annual vaccination of adults with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) confers significant protection against influenza each year.’ However, the trial results should be interpreted cautiously due to several limitations. The multivac group included both randomized and non-randomized participants – an important caveat since baseline influenza risk may have been different due to more frequent prior natural infection in those who were unvaccinated at the time of study entry. The primary clinical end point included serologic criteria (seroconversion), a well-recognized source of bias. In addition, relatively few cases of virus-confirmed influenza were identified within each vaccine exposure group and season, limiting power to detect differences. The generalizability of the study is further limited because the whole virus vaccine that was licensed at that time has been replaced with split or subunit vaccine formulations.\n",
    "2.3.  Antigenic distance hypothesis In 1999, a potential explanation for the variation in repeated vaccination effects was proposed by Smith and colleagues based on a computer simulation of B-cell clones with different antigen specificities [ Citation 12 ]. According to this ‘antigenic distance hypothesis’, vaccine efficacy is influenced by the antigenic similarity between the prior season vaccine strain and the epidemic strain (v1–e), and the antigenic similarity between the current and prior season vaccine strains (v1–v2). In the theoretical model, negative and positive interference was determined by two competing immune processes: v2 antigen trapping by v1 antibody, and v2 stimulation of a v1 memory response that cross-reacts with the epidemic strain (e). The computer model considered a simplified scenario with two influenza seasons and challenge with epidemic virus in the second season. The first season vaccine had varying antigenic distance to the second season vaccine (v1–v2 distance) and to the epidemic strain (v1–e distance). The antigenic distance between the second season vaccine (v2) and the epidemic strain was held constant (v2–e = 2, or antigenically similar). This was explored for other homologous vaccine scenarios (v1 = v2) for v2–e distances ranging from one to three. The simulation examined outcomes in four groups: (1) individuals not vaccinated either season; (2) those receiving v1 only; (3) those receiving v2 only; and (4) those vaccinated in both seasons (v1 + v2). The model demonstrated that repeat vaccination could lead to higher or lower attack rates compared to first-time vaccination depending upon conditions of v1–v2 and v1–e relatedness. A lower attack rate (positive interference) was observed in repeat vaccinees than first-time vaccinees when v1 was antigenically close to the epidemic strain. A higher attack rate (negative interference) was observed in repeat vaccinees when the antigenic distance between v1 and v2 was small and v1 was antigenically distinct from the epidemic strain. This effect was pronounced when v1 and v2 strains were identical (i.e. homologous), and attack rates were higher in both single and repeat vaccinees with increasing antigenic distance between the vaccine and epidemic strain. The model was tested using the results from the 1972 and 1974 (but not 1976) British boarding school outbreaks and the multiseason randomized clinical trial results based on serologic and virologic outcomes with randomized and non-randomized participants [ Citation 9 ]. The model did not predict absolute vaccine efficacy, but there was a high correlation ( r = 0.87) between the observed results and the predicted ratio of efficacy in repeat vs. first-time vaccinees.\n",

    "===== 2.1.  British boarding school outbreaks =====\n",
    "The earliest reports regarding potential negative effects of repeated annual vaccination were published in a series of three papers describing influenza outbreaks at a British boarding school from 1972 to 1976 when only A/H3N2 and type B viruses were circulating. The initial publication described a 3-year randomized clinical trial that began in October 1970 [ Citation 6 ]. Participating youth, 11–19 years old, were randomly assigned to receive a subcutaneous dose of whole virus inactivated vaccine containing either influenza A or B. For each of the subsequent two seasons, previously enrolled boys were revaccinated with the same A/Hong Kong/1/68 vaccine and new entrants were randomized. An influenza H3N2 outbreak caused by A/England/42/72 occurred in December 1972, and the authors reported no significant difference in the attack rate for boys who had received one, two, or three doses of vaccine. However, the attack rates were not reported for each group.\n",
    "A subsequent 1974 outbreak of A/Port Chalmers/1/73 demonstrated that vaccination in an earlier season can indirectly affect the risk of infection in a future season [ Citation 7 ]. The H3N2 attack rate in 1974 was significantly higher in boys who had previously received the A/Hong Kong vaccine in 1970–1972 compared with those who had not. The authors attributed this paradoxical finding of increased risk to the fact that ‘the A/Hong Kong vaccine, by reducing the proportion infected during the A/England outbreak, actually increased the proportion susceptible to attack during the subsequent outbreak of A/Port Chalmers’ (i.e. infection block hypothesis). However, even among boys uninfected in the 1972 outbreak, the attack rate in 1974 was still 50% higher in those who had previously received the A/Hong Kong vaccine (27/45, 60%) vs. the influenza B vaccine (11/26, 40%) ( p = .15).\n",
    "The third boarding school outbreak occurred in the spring of 1976 [ Citation 8 ]. The 1976 outbreak was caused by a new H3N2 antigenic cluster: A/Victoria/3/75. The investigators compared attack rates in 1976 for boys who had received the current A/Port Chalmers vaccine with no prior vaccination, those previously vaccinated, and unvaccinated boys. This analysis was restricted to 375 boys who attended school during all three outbreaks and was based on receipt of prior strains rather than number of vaccine doses. Accordingly, the total number of doses received in the ‘repeat vaccination’ group may have ranged from 3 to 5 ( Table 1 ). Table 1. Influenza A vaccines administered by season and year of matriculation at Christ’s Hospital Boarding School. Influenza A (H3N2) outbreaks occurred in December 1972, spring 1974, and spring 1976. Download CSV Display Table\n",
    "The attack rate among boys who received the A/Port Chalmers vaccine without prior vaccine doses was about 30% lower compared to boys who were completely unvaccinated ( Figure 1 ). Conversely, the attack rate was nearly 50% higher in those who had received all three influenza A vaccines: A/Port Chalmers + A/England + A/Hong Kong compared to the completely unvaccinated boys. The same patterns were observed among boys regardless of prior infection history during the first two outbreaks, suggesting that the infection block hypothesis does not explain all of the differences observed. However, the sample size was small in each vaccine group, and there were no statistically significant differences in attack rates across the three vaccine groups. Figure 1. Influenza A attack rates and vaccination status at a British boarding school during the 1976 outbreak. The analysis was restricted to students attending school during all three outbreaks. We estimated the attack rates for boys not previously infected (light gray bars) by recalculating the denominators after excluding ‘Cases 1972: A/England’ and ‘Cases 1974: A/Port Chalmers’ as shown in the original publication. The A/Port Chalmers/1/73 vaccine (‘A/PC’) was co-administered with A/England/42/72 for the 1974–75 season, and with A/Scotland/840/74 for the 1975–76 season. Data for this figure were derived from Figure 2 of reference [ Citation 8 ] and reprinted from The Lancet, Vol 313/Issue 8106, T.W. Hoskins, Joan R. Davies, A.J. Smith, Christine L.

    "The cumulative attack rate across all three outbreaks was similar among boys who were unvaccinated during the entire period (51%) and boys who were appropriately vaccinated before each outbreak (41%). These findings led the authors to question the net benefit of repeated annual vaccination: ‘These observations on three outbreaks of influenza A in a school suggest that annual revaccination with inactivated influenza A vaccine confers no long term advantage. The practice of offering annual revaccination to adults seems open to question.’\n",

    "===== 2.2.  Repeated vaccination randomized trial =====\n",
    "The concern that repeated annual vaccination might reduce vaccine efficacy led the US National Institutes of Health to fund a 5-year randomized clinical trial. The trial was conducted from 1983 to 1988 and final results published in 1997 [ Citation 9 ]. Healthy 30–60 year-old adults were recruited to receive either licensed, trivalent inactivated whole virus vaccine (TIV, Connaught Laboratories) or placebo. Some, but not all, study participants were randomized. New study participants were randomly assigned to receive TIV or placebo only if they had not received influenza vaccine in the past 3 years (first vac group). Those who had been vaccinated in the past three years were assigned to the multiple vaccination (multivac) group and TIV was administered each fall for the duration of the study. As a result, the multivac group included both randomized and non-randomized individuals. Each fall, participants who had previously received placebo were re-randomized to receive vaccine (first vac group) or placebo ( Figure 2 ). Serum samples were collected pre- and post-vaccination and after each season to assess hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response to vaccine and epidemic strains. There was no active illness surveillance, but participants were encouraged to report respiratory illness episodes; nasal washes were obtained for virus isolation in cell culture.\n",

    "For this review, we undertook a meta-analysis of studies conducted after the 2009 pandemic to evaluate the effects of prior season vaccination on current season vaccine effectiveness (VE) by type/subtype. We restricted this analysis to studies that considered the effect of current and/or prior season vaccination using a four-level exposure variable: vaccinated current season only (not prior), vaccinated prior season only (not current), vaccinated both seasons, or unvaccinated in both seasons (referent group).\n",
    "3.1.  Search strategy and selection criteria We searched for English language studies published from 1 January 2009 to 3 August 2016 that reported vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against RT-PCR-confirmed influenza illness. We searched Medline, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, and other databases using combinations of search terms that included ‘influenza’, ‘vaccines’, ‘treatment outcomes’, ‘efficacy’, and ‘effectiveness’. The specific search terms are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. We included studies conducted in the outpatient, inpatient, or community setting, but inpatient studies were summarized separately since VE for preventing influenza hospitalization may not be comparable to VE in the outpatient setting. We included observational studies using the test-negative design, case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials. To reduce bias, we restricted the analysis to studies that applied standard symptom or syndrome criteria for enrollment. The specific symptom eligibility criteria were variable, but studies were excluded if they used a convenience sample of clinical diagnostic tests rather than predefined screening criteria. Studies were included if they reported VE against H3N2, H1N1pdm09, or type B for a single season and assessed vaccination status in the current and immediate past season. We excluded cost-effectiveness studies, review articles, and studies using nonspecific clinical or serologic end points. Studies reporting current season VE for either pre-2009 seasonal vaccines or monovalent H1N1pdm09 vaccine were excluded to ensure maximum relevance for current seasonal vaccination. The end points for the meta-analysis were vaccine effectiveness against RT-PCR-confirmed influenza illness by type or subtype. We included one publication after 3 August 2016 because results were available to us before online publication on 4 October 2016 [ Citation 13 ]. The specific search terms are shown in the online appendix, and the protocol is available from the authors on request.\n",
    "3.2.  Data analysis Two reviewers abstracted data for eligibility criteria, study characteristics, and VE estimates using a structured electronic data collection form. Discrepancies were reviewed and corrected by one author with approval of all reviewers. Pooled estimates were generated using separate simple random-effects models [ Citation 14 ] to calculate the weighted pooled log odds ratio and corresponding VE and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each level of vaccine exposure compared to unvaccinated in both seasons. Vaccination in the prior season only was interpreted as residual protection. Weights for each model were calculated using inverse variances that incorporated the between-study variance [ Citation 14 , Citation 15 ]. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the χ -based Q test and I statistic [ Citation 15 ]. The primary analysis included studies for all seasons with no age restriction beyond childhood. Pooled estimates were also generated when there were ≥3 individual estimates for each season. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.\n",
    "3.3.  Results We identified 4636 unduplicated publications and selected 183 for full-text review for eligibility ( Figure 4 ). Eighteen studies met the eligibility criteria [ Citation 4 , Citation 13 , Citation 16 – Citation 31 ]. Of these, one study was restricted to hospitalized patients and was therefore excluded from the meta-analysis [ Citation 31 ]. All studies originated in the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority from North America ( Table 2 ). Most (82%) studies enrolled outpatients with medically attended acute respiratory illness, 1 enrolled both outpatients and inpatients, and 2 enrolled participants from the community in a household cohort study. The 17 publications included 31 sets (current only, prior only, and both seasons) of VE estimates that included unrestricted age groups. Characteristics of included studies by season, subtype, and age group are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Table 2. Characteristics of 17 published studies that met eligibility criteria for assessment of current and prior season vaccine effectiveness. Download CSV Display Table Figure 4. Flow chart for screening and selection of articles for inclusion in meta-analysis of repeated vaccination and vaccine effectiveness. Display full size VE estimates were consistently lowest for H3N2 across all vaccine groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in repeat vaccination effects within and between seasons and subtypes. When negative effects of prior vaccination were observed, they were most pronounced for H3N2, notably driven by two studies in the 2014–2015 season. The pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution since the antigenic relatedness of vaccine and virus strains varies by season and subtype. 3.3.1.  H3N2 H3N2 VE estimates by current and prior vaccination status were available from seven studies and three seasons, including 2011–2012 ( n = 2), 2012–2013 ( n = 2), and 2014–2015 ( n = 3). The vaccine strain was unchanged in two of these seasons (2011–2012 and 2014–2015). There was evidence of antigenic mismatch with the vaccine strain in two seasons. In 2012–2013, circulating viruses were well matched to the WHO cell-propagated reference strain, but antigenic mismatch occurred from mutations in high-growth reassortant viruses used for vaccine manufacturing [ Citation 25 ]. In 2014–2015, the vaccine reference strain was poorly matched to the dominant circulating strain from a new antigenic cluster [ Citation 32 ]. Studies were contributed from Canada ( n = 3), the US ( n = 3), and European multi-country ( n = 1). In general, H3N2 estimates were highest for vaccination in the current season only. Pooled estimates for H3N2 were 39%, 17%, and 9%, respectively, for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination ( Figure 5 ). The pooled VE was statistically significant (i.e. greater than zero) for current season vaccination only; pooled VE was not significant for repeated vaccination. However, heterogeneity was high for vaccination in current season only ( I = 73%, p = .003) and in both prior and current season ( I = 86%, p < .0001) suggesting important underlying variability for which pooled analysis may not be appropriate. Conversely, the observation of no residual protection from prior season vaccination was more consistent, with lower heterogeneity ( I = 48%, p = .1). Of note, two of three studies reported pronounced difference between repeated versus current season only vaccination during the 2014–2015 season [ Citation 28 , Citation 30 ], and this difference was statistically significant in one study [ Citation 28 ]. Vaccine strains were unchanged and there was well-recognized mismatch between vaccine and epidemic strains, a pattern consistent with the antigenic distance hypothesis. However, this difference was not observed in the 2014–2015 U.S. Flu VE Network Study which had more influenza cases with repeated vaccination and single season vaccination than the other two studies combined [ Citation 13 ]. Figure 5. Vaccine effectiveness for H3N2 studies without age restriction. For each VE estimate, the comparison group included individuals who were unvaccinated in both the current and prior season. Display full size 3.3.2.  H1N1pdm09 H1N1pdm09 VE estimates by current and prior season vaccination status were available from ten studies and four seasons, including 2010–2011 ( n = 5), 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2013–2014 ( n = 3), and 2014–2015 ( n = 1). Studies were contributed from more diverse countries than for H3N2, including Canada ( n = 3), Spain ( n = 2), the US ( n = 2), Finland ( n = 1), the UK ( n = 1), and European multi-country ( n = 1). Recommended vaccine strains were identical across all seasons ( Table 3 ) and considered antigenically similar to circulating H1N1pdm09 viruses across this period despite the emergence of a new genetic variant (clade 6B) in 2013 [ Citation 27 ]. It is noteworthy that studies included a mix of countries that had used mostly AS03-adjuvanted monovalent H1N1pdm09 vaccine in response to the 2009 pandemic (e.g. Canada, Finland, Spain, or UK), or exclusively non-adjuvanted product (e.g. US), or a combination (e.g. multi-country European study). The impact of adjuvanted monovalent vaccine use on the magnitude or duration of repeated vaccination effects is unknown. Prior to 2013–2014, H1N1pdm09 estimates were contributed solely from outside the US and were generally higher for repeat vaccinees than current season only vaccine recipients, with suggestion also of substantial residual protection from prior season vaccination.

Download CSV Display Table Pooled estimates in 2010–2011 for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination were 54%, 69%, and 61%, respectively ( Figure 6 ). These were each statistically significant relative to no vaccination. Conversely, studies from Canada and the US in 2013–2014 showed similar or slightly lower VE among persons repeatedly vaccinated vs. those vaccinated in the current season only; VE was lower but still significant for those vaccinated only in the prior (2012–2013) season. In the overall pooled analysis across all seasons, heterogeneity was high for repeated vaccination ( I = 69%, p = .002), with more consistency in findings for vaccination in the current season only ( I = 0%, p = .9) or prior season only ( I = 40%, p = .1).

For each VE estimate, the comparison group included individuals who were unvaccinated in both the current and prior season. Display full size 3.3.3.  Type B Influenza B VE estimates by current and prior vaccination history were available for both lineages (combined) from five studies and four seasons including 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2012–2013 ( n = 1), 2013–2014 ( n = 1), and 2014–2015 ( n = 2). Lineage-specific estimates for B/Yamagata were available from six studies and four seasons including 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2012–2013 ( n = 2), 2013–2014 ( n = 1), and 2014–2015 ( n = 2). For B/Victoria, there were only three studies involving two seasons: 2011–2012 ( n = 1) and 2012–2013 ( n = 2). Influenza B studies were contributed from Canada ( n = 10), the US ( n = 3), and European multi-country ( n = 1). Quadrivalent inactivated vaccines containing both B lineages were first licensed in the US in 2013, but most vaccines administered during the study period were trivalent and contained only one B lineage. The same B/Victoria lineage strain (Brisbane/60/2008) was included as trivalent vaccine component from 2009–2010 to 2011–2012, and a B/Yamagata lineage was included from 2012–2013 through 2014–2015 ( Table 3 ). There was circulation of both lineages in 2011–2012 and 2012–2013, whereas the B/Yamagata lineage dominated in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 with clade variation relative to vaccine in both seasons. VE estimates for B overall were similar or slightly higher for repeat vaccination compared to current season only during 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 seasons of mixed lineage circulation, but were lower during 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 seasons of lineage-matched (B/Yamagata) but clade-mismatched circulation ( Figure 7 ). Consequently, pooling across the four seasons resulted in overall minimal differences between the two vaccine groups for influenza B. Pooled estimates for type B were 61%, 55%, and 25%, respectively, for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination. The lineage-level analysis demonstrated a similar pattern for B/Yamagata in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015, with lower VE estimates in repeat vaccinees. With so few studies and seasons, a pattern for B/Victoria is difficult to discern. Figure 7. Vaccine effectiveness for type B (all), B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria studies without age restriction. For each VE estimate, the comparison group included individuals who were unvaccinated in both the current and prior season.

    "We searched for English language studies published from 1 January 2009 to 3 August 2016 that reported vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against RT-PCR-confirmed influenza illness. We searched Medline, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, and other databases using combinations of search terms that included ‘influenza’, ‘vaccines’, ‘treatment outcomes’, ‘efficacy’, and ‘effectiveness’. The specific search terms are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. We included studies conducted in the outpatient, inpatient, or community setting, but inpatient studies were summarized separately since VE for preventing influenza hospitalization may not be comparable to VE in the outpatient setting. We included observational studies using the test-negative design, case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials. To reduce bias, we restricted the analysis to studies that applied standard symptom or syndrome criteria for enrollment. The specific symptom eligibility criteria were variable, but studies were excluded if they used a convenience sample of clinical diagnostic tests rather than predefined screening criteria. Studies were included if they reported VE against H3N2, H1N1pdm09, or type B for a single season and assessed vaccination status in the current and immediate past season. We excluded cost-effectiveness studies, review articles, and studies using nonspecific clinical or serologic end points. Studies reporting current season VE for either pre-2009 seasonal vaccines or monovalent H1N1pdm09 vaccine were excluded to ensure maximum relevance for current seasonal vaccination. The end points for the meta-analysis were vaccine effectiveness against RT-PCR-confirmed influenza illness by type or subtype.\n",
    "We included one publication after 3 August 2016 because results were available to us before online publication on 4 October 2016 [ Citation 13 ]. The specific search terms are shown in the online appendix, and the protocol is available from the authors on request.\n",

    "Two reviewers abstracted data for eligibility criteria, study characteristics, and VE estimates using a structured electronic data collection form. Discrepancies were reviewed and corrected by one author with approval of all reviewers. Pooled estimates were generated using separate simple random-effects models [ Citation 14 ] to calculate the weighted pooled log odds ratio and corresponding VE and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each level of vaccine exposure compared to unvaccinated in both seasons. Vaccination in the prior season only was interpreted as residual protection. Weights for each model were calculated using inverse variances that incorporated the between-study variance [ Citation 14 , Citation 15 ]. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the χ -based Q test and I statistic [ Citation 15 ].\n",
    "The primary analysis included studies for all seasons with no age restriction beyond childhood. Pooled estimates were also generated when there were ≥3 individual estimates for each season. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.\n",

    "We identified 4636 unduplicated publications and selected 183 for full-text review for eligibility ( Figure 4 ). Eighteen studies met the eligibility criteria [ Citation 4 , Citation 13 , Citation 16 – Citation 31 ]. Of these, one study was restricted to hospitalized patients and was therefore excluded from the meta-analysis [ Citation 31 ]. All studies originated in the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority from North America ( Table 2 ). Most (82%) studies enrolled outpatients with medically attended acute respiratory illness, 1 enrolled both outpatients and inpatients, and 2 enrolled participants from the community in a household cohort study. The 17 publications included 31 sets (current only, prior only, and both seasons) of VE estimates that included unrestricted age groups. Characteristics of included studies by season, subtype, and age group are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Table 2.

    "VE estimates were consistently lowest for H3N2 across all vaccine groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in repeat vaccination effects within and between seasons and subtypes. When negative effects of prior vaccination were observed, they were most pronounced for H3N2, notably driven by two studies in the 2014–2015 season. The pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution since the antigenic relatedness of vaccine and virus strains varies by season and subtype.\n",
    "3.3.1.  H3N2 H3N2 VE estimates by current and prior vaccination status were available from seven studies and three seasons, including 2011–2012 ( n = 2), 2012–2013 ( n = 2), and 2014–2015 ( n = 3). The vaccine strain was unchanged in two of these seasons (2011–2012 and 2014–2015). There was evidence of antigenic mismatch with the vaccine strain in two seasons. In 2012–2013, circulating viruses were well matched to the WHO cell-propagated reference strain, but antigenic mismatch occurred from mutations in high-growth reassortant viruses used for vaccine manufacturing [ Citation 25 ]. In 2014–2015, the vaccine reference strain was poorly matched to the dominant circulating strain from a new antigenic cluster [ Citation 32 ]. Studies were contributed from Canada ( n = 3), the US ( n = 3), and European multi-country ( n = 1). In general, H3N2 estimates were highest for vaccination in the current season only. Pooled estimates for H3N2 were 39%, 17%, and 9%, respectively, for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination ( Figure 5 ). The pooled VE was statistically significant (i.e. greater than zero) for current season vaccination only; pooled VE was not significant for repeated vaccination. However, heterogeneity was high for vaccination in current season only ( I = 73%, p = .003) and in both prior and current season ( I = 86%, p < .0001) suggesting important underlying variability for which pooled analysis may not be appropriate. Conversely, the observation of no residual protection from prior season vaccination was more consistent, with lower heterogeneity ( I = 48%, p = .1). Of note, two of three studies reported pronounced difference between repeated versus current season only vaccination during the 2014–2015 season [ Citation 28 , Citation 30 ], and this difference was statistically significant in one study [ Citation 28 ]. Vaccine strains were unchanged and there was well-recognized mismatch between vaccine and epidemic strains, a pattern consistent with the antigenic distance hypothesis. However, this difference was not observed in the 2014–2015 U.S. Flu VE Network Study which had more influenza cases with repeated vaccination and single season vaccination than the other two studies combined [ Citation 13 ].

    "3.3.2.  H1N1pdm09 H1N1pdm09 VE estimates by current and prior season vaccination status were available from ten studies and four seasons, including 2010–2011 ( n = 5), 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2013–2014 ( n = 3), and 2014–2015 ( n = 1). Studies were contributed from more diverse countries than for H3N2, including Canada ( n = 3), Spain ( n = 2), the US ( n = 2), Finland ( n = 1), the UK ( n = 1), and European multi-country ( n = 1). Recommended vaccine strains were identical across all seasons ( Table 3 ) and considered antigenically similar to circulating H1N1pdm09 viruses across this period despite the emergence of a new genetic variant (clade 6B) in 2013 [ Citation 27 ]. It is noteworthy that studies included a mix of countries that had used mostly AS03-adjuvanted monovalent H1N1pdm09 vaccine in response to the 2009 pandemic (e.g. Canada, Finland, Spain, or UK), or exclusively non-adjuvanted product (e.g. US), or a combination (e.g. multi-country European study). The impact of adjuvanted monovalent vaccine use on the magnitude or duration of repeated vaccination effects is unknown. Prior to 2013–2014, H1N1pdm09 estimates were contributed solely from outside the US and were generally higher for repeat vaccinees than current season only vaccine recipients, with suggestion also of substantial residual protection from prior season vaccination.

Download CSV Display Table Pooled estimates in 2010–2011 for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination were 54%, 69%, and 61%, respectively ( Figure 6 ). These were each statistically significant relative to no vaccination. Conversely, studies from Canada and the US in 2013–2014 showed similar or slightly lower VE among persons repeatedly vaccinated vs. those vaccinated in the current season only; VE was lower but still significant for those vaccinated only in the prior (2012–2013) season. In the overall pooled analysis across all seasons, heterogeneity was high for repeated vaccination ( I = 69%, p = .002), with more consistency in findings for vaccination in the current season only ( I = 0%, p = .9) or prior season only ( I = 40%, p = .1).

    "3.3.3.  Type B Influenza B VE estimates by current and prior vaccination history were available for both lineages (combined) from five studies and four seasons including 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2012–2013 ( n = 1), 2013–2014 ( n = 1), and 2014–2015 ( n = 2). Lineage-specific estimates for B/Yamagata were available from six studies and four seasons including 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2012–2013 ( n = 2), 2013–2014 ( n = 1), and 2014–2015 ( n = 2). For B/Victoria, there were only three studies involving two seasons: 2011–2012 ( n = 1) and 2012–2013 ( n = 2). Influenza B studies were contributed from Canada ( n = 10), the US ( n = 3), and European multi-country ( n = 1). Quadrivalent inactivated vaccines containing both B lineages were first licensed in the US in 2013, but most vaccines administered during the study period were trivalent and contained only one B lineage. The same B/Victoria lineage strain (Brisbane/60/2008) was included as trivalent vaccine component from 2009–2010 to 2011–2012, and a B/Yamagata lineage was included from 2012–2013 through 2014–2015 ( Table 3 ). There was circulation of both lineages in 2011–2012 and 2012–2013, whereas the B/Yamagata lineage dominated in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 with clade variation relative to vaccine in both seasons. VE estimates for B overall were similar or slightly higher for repeat vaccination compared to current season only during 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 seasons of mixed lineage circulation, but were lower during 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 seasons of lineage-matched (B/Yamagata) but clade-mismatched circulation ( Figure 7 ). Consequently, pooling across the four seasons resulted in overall minimal differences between the two vaccine groups for influenza B. Pooled estimates for type B were 61%, 55%, and 25%, respectively, for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination. The lineage-level analysis demonstrated a similar pattern for B/Yamagata in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015, with lower VE estimates in repeat vaccinees. With so few studies and seasons, a pattern for B/Victoria is difficult to discern. Figure 7. Vaccine effectiveness for type B (all), B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria studies without age restriction. For each VE estimate, the comparison group included individuals who were unvaccinated in both the current and prior season. Display full size In most studies and in pooled analyses, both groups of current vaccine recipients (with or without prior season vaccination) had higher VE than prior season only recipients although residual protection from prior season vaccination was evident and statistically significant in pooled analyses for influenza B and B/Yamagata.

    "===== 4.  VE studies of repeated vaccination in multiple prior seasons =====\n",
    "Few studies have evaluated the impact of repeated vaccination on clinical efficacy or effectiveness since the randomized trial was conducted in the 1980s [ Citation 9 ]. A large observational study on repeat vaccination effects was conducted over eight seasons in Marshfield, Wisconsin [ Citation 33 ]. In this rural community, the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute has conducted annual studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design since 2004–2005 [ Citation 18 , Citation 23 , Citation 34 – Citation 36 ]. Each season, eligible individuals are enrolled and swabbed when seeking outpatient care for acute respiratory illness. Influenza vaccination dates over a 5-year period were determined using a validated, web-based electronic immunization registry [ Citation 37 ].\n",
    "To analyze prior vaccination effects over multiple seasons, multivariate models evaluated the association between RT-PCR-confirmed influenza (outcome) and exposure variables for current season vaccination and 5-year vaccination history. The latter was classified as frequent vaccinee (at least four of five past seasons), infrequent vaccinee (1–3 vaccines), or nonvaccinee (unvaccinated in prior five seasons). The comparison group included individuals who were unvaccinated in the current season and all of the preceding five seasons.\n",
    "The analysis included 5800 study participants who were in the community cohort for at least five continuous years. Current season VE against H3N2 was significantly higher (65%; 95% CI 36–80) among nonvaccinees (i.e. those vaccinated in current season but not any of the prior 5 years) compared to frequent vaccinees (24%; 95% CI 3–41). A secondary analysis stratified by H3N2 season (2007–2008 and 2012–2013) yielded results similar to the overall analysis, but interpretation was limited by the smaller sample size and wide CIs.\n",
    "For influenza B, VE was significantly higher for vaccinated individuals who were unvaccinated during the prior five seasons (VE 75%; 95% CI 50–87) compared to those who were frequent vaccinees (VE 48%; 95% CI 29–62). There was evidence of residual protection against type B among frequent and infrequent vaccinees who did not receive the current season vaccine.\n",
    "An additional study assessed the impact of prior vaccination in one and/or two seasons on vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 during the 2014–2015 season in Canada [ Citation 28 ]. In this study, patients were enrolled by sentinel physicians, and current and prior vaccinations were determined by physician records and/or self-report. In the analysis that considered only current and prior season vaccination, there was a borderline significant elevated risk of influenza (negative VE) among individuals repeatedly vaccinated (2013–2014 and 2014–2015) compared to those unvaccinated in both seasons (VE −32%; 95% CI −75 to 0). In the analysis that considered vaccine receipt in two prior seasons, there was a significant increased risk of influenza among those who were vaccinated for three consecutive seasons (including the 2014–2015 season) compared to those who were unvaccinated during all three seasons (VE −54%; 95% CI −108 to −14).\n",
    "A study using the test-negative design evaluated VE in Navarra, Spain, during the 2014–2015 season with vaccine exposure assessed over a three-season period: 2012–2013 through 2014–2015 [ Citation 38 ]. This study found no significant protection against H3N2 in any vaccine group, but protection against influenza B was high (>80%) among current season only vaccinees and among patients who were vaccinated in two prior seasons only (not current season). Conversely, VE against influenza B was lower (43%) but still significant among patients who were vaccinated all three seasons. Generalizability of these results is limited because the study pooled inpatient and outpatient cases of influenza, and vaccine formulations were systematically different in the prior seasons (split vaccine only) versus the current season (subunit vaccine only).\n",
    "Finally, three Canadian test-negative studies conducted in 2011–2012 through 2013–2014 reported VE against H1N1pdm09 for current and/or prior season TIV receipt, with or without 2009 monovalent pandemic vaccine (mostly containing AS03 adjuvant) [ Citation 25 – Citation 27 ]. During the first two seasons, there was nonsignificant residual protection (VE ~50%) against H1N1pdm09 from prior 2009 monovalent vaccine receipt despite no subsequent TIV doses. By 2013–2014 this residual monovalent vaccine protection was essentially zero (VE ~1%). Across the study period, repeat vaccine recipients were better protected than the consistently unvaccinated or those who received only the 2009 monovalent vaccine.\n",

    "===== 5.  Immunogenicity studies of repeated vaccination =====\n",
    "Several studies since the 2009 pandemic have assessed the impact of repeated vaccination on adaptive immune response. Although earlier studies have shown that prior vaccinees are less likely to seroconvert after vaccine receipt than first-time vaccinees, the more recent studies demonstrate that repeated vaccination can blunt the antibody response to hemagglutinin even after adjusting for prevaccination titer.\n",
    "5.1.  Michigan clinical trial A study at the University of Michigan demonstrated that blunting of the serologic response to IIV can persist up to 18 months after repeat vaccination. Investigators collected serial serum samples from adults who participated in a randomized trial comparing IIV and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) efficacy in 2004–2005 and 2005–2006 [ Citation 39 ]. Subjects were randomized to receive LAIV, IIV, or placebo in 2004–2005, and each group received the same intervention during the second season while new recruits were randomized. In the second season, nearly all IIV recipients had postvaccination HI titers ≥32 for both H3N2 and B/Yamagata, and the estimated time to a 50% (2-fold) decrease in titer was 410 days for H3N2 and 424 days for B/Yamagata. The GMTs remained significantly lower ( p < .001) in the repeat IIV group compared to the single IIV group at all four time points up to 18-month postvaccination.\n",
    "5.2.  Michigan household cohort study Another study at the University of Michigan found blunting of the H3N2 vaccine response in a cohort study with 321 households (1426 members) during the 2012–2013 season [ Citation 21 ]. Subjects with any vaccine exposure had higher titers than those who were unvaccinated in both 2012–2013 and the prior season. The HI titer against H3N2 was significantly higher ( p = .03) in single vaccinees (current season only) compared to repeat vaccinees. There were no significant differences for the other antigens or for neuraminidase titers. A similar household cohort study in 2013–2014 found no difference in preseason HI titers against H1N1pdm09 among persons vaccinated in two consecutive seasons (2012–2013 and 2013–2014) and those vaccinated only in the current (2013–2014) season [ Citation 22 ]. Neuraminidase inhibition titers were also similar in these two groups.\n",
    "5.3.  Serologic response to repeated vaccination in health-care workers In 2010–2011, blunting of the serologic response to the H3N2 vaccine strain was demonstrated in a cohort of 816 health-care workers [ Citation 40 ]. The investigators aimed to determine if there was a dose–response relationship between the number of prior influenza vaccinations (up to four) and the HI response to A/Perth/16/2009, the WHO-recommended H3N2 component of the 2010–2011 vaccine. Health-care workers who had received one or more doses of IIV in the past 4 years all had similar adjusted prevaccination titers, but the adjusted geometric mean fold rise (MFR) after vaccination was inversely associated with the number of prior vaccinations. The MFR was 6.2 (95% CI 3.4–11.3) among those with no prior vaccinations, 4.3 (95% CI 3.3–5.5) among those with one prior vaccination, and 2.3 (95% CI 2.1–2.6) among those with four prior vaccinations. The findings were similar when the analysis was stratified into groups with low (<40) and high (≥40) baseline titers against H3N2. Post-season H3N2 titers were highest in participants who received only one vaccination in the prior four seasons. There was a consistent inverse association between vaccine serologic response to A/Perth/16/2009 and the number of prior vaccine doses containing A/Wisconsin/67/2005 used in 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 but not the more recent A/Brisbane/10/2007 vaccine strain used in 2008–2009 and 2009–2010. The authors proposed differential responses to historic vaccines to explain this apparent paradox.\n",
    "5.4.  Serologic response in young and older adults with repeated vaccination An open-label clinical trial over four seasons suggested that the declining serologic response to influenza vaccination in older adults may be partially attributed to repeat vaccination effects rather than immunosenescence [ Citation 41 ]. Each year, healthy young adults (20–40 years) who had never received influenza vaccine and healthy older adults (≥65 years) who had not been vaccinated in the prior 2 years were recruited. All new and returning participants received licensed IIV in the fall, and paired serum samples were collected. For all seasons and subtypes combined, the initial prevaccination GMTs were nearly identical in the young and old cohorts, but postvaccination GMT was nearly twice as high in the younger vs. older adults. This age effect diminished with increasing number of repeated vaccinations. After an individual had received two or more vaccine doses within the study, the age effect disappeared, and this was observed for all three vaccine subtypes.\n",

    "===== 6.  Possible immune mechanisms for repeated vaccination effects =====\n",
    "All vaccines are intended to trigger an immunological response, but influenza is the only vaccine for which components must be updated routinely due to virus antigenic evolution. It is the only vaccine given every year. This has poorly understood effects that may vary depending on whether the vaccine strain has been changed compared to the prior season(s), changes in the genetic and antigenic characteristics of circulating viruses, and the unique ‘antibody landscape’ determined by cumulative lifetime experience with influenza infection or vaccination [ Citation 42 ]. As noted in the 1974 British boarding school outbreak [ Citation 7 ], natural infection appears to convey broader and more durable immunity relative to vaccination [ Citation 43 ]. As proposed by Hoskins et al., vaccine-induced protection in a given season may block the greater infection-induced immunity and thereby contribute to higher risk in a subsequent season (infection block hypothesis). However, the infection block hypothesis is unlikely to explain all of the increased risk among repeat vaccinees in the British boarding school outbreaks.\n",
    "The antigenic distance hypothesis has been the major theoretical framework for understanding variability in repeat influenza vaccination effects. It remains a useful tool for interpreting repeated vaccination effects, but it is likely an incomplete conceptualization. The predictions of this hypothesis are based entirely on the HI antibody response, but the adaptive immune response to other virus components (i.e. HA2 or neuraminidase) is likely to contribute. It was intended to predict relative but not absolute vaccine effectiveness, and it incorporates only a single prior season. It therefore does not consider more distant virus or vaccine exposures that may also shape the immune response to influenza vaccine. The potential for increased risk among repeatedly vaccinated individuals and the heterosubtypic effects of trivalent or quadrivalent vaccine were also not considered by the antigenic distance hypothesis [ Citation 12 ].\n",
    "Other immunological mechanisms that extend or complement the antigenic distance hypothesis should be considered. It has long been recognized that prominent recall of memory responses to distant priming (imprinting) antigens can shape hierarchical antibody responses to influenza (a.k.a. original antigenic sin). Annual vaccination, as opposed to less frequent infection exposure, may hasten such ‘sinful’ antibody refocusing toward prior versus evolved epitopes, preferentially selecting for cross-reactive but non-neutralizing memory responses [ Citation 44 – Citation 47 ]. In the context of pre-existing antibody, immune complex formation and Fc-receptor activation can lead to suppression of B cell responses to subsequent influenza vaccination [ Citation 48 ]. Whether antibody-dependent mechanisms may also suppress T cell responses to influenza, as described in other virus models, is an area requiring further research [ Citation 49 ]. The preferential induction or recruitment of regulatory cells upon re-exposure has been proposed as an explanatory mechanism for original antigenic sin responses and may also contribute to antagonistic T cell responses with repeat influenza vaccination [ Citation 50 ]. There is evidence from animal studies that repeated vaccination can interfere with the development of cross-reactive immunity against other subtypes, likely mediated by reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell response [ Citation 51 , Citation 52 ]. In children, annual vaccination has also been demonstrated to hamper development of virus-specific CD8+ T cell immunity [ Citation 53 ]. The implications remain unclear, but these findings raise the possibility that repeated vaccination of low-risk individuals could affect the occurrence or severity of illness caused by a new pandemic virus or a new seasonal virus antigenic cluster.\n",
    "Scientific investigation into the immunologic effects of annual vaccination remains severely lacking, particularly the long-term effects of repeated vaccination over decades and the specific preconditions for negative interference in some seasons. Ultimately, the mechanisms to explain the variable and potential negative effects of repeat vaccination remain unknown, but they are likely multi-factorial and will require a coordinated research strategy and a complex systems biology perspective to address comprehensively [ Citation 54 ].\n",

    "===== 7.  Methodological challenges for evaluation of repeated vaccination effects =====\n",
    "Experimental studies can randomize participants to ensure that study arms are comparable in their risk of acquiring the disease and prognostic factors outside vaccination. This is not possible with observational studies, which have methodological challenges such as selection bias and residual confounding. For analysis of repeat vaccination effects, this translates into some specific challenges. Most individuals habitually engage in the same pattern of vaccination (or nonvaccination) every year. Only a small proportion are vaccinated for the first time in a given season, seriously limiting the statistical power for VE comparisons between first-time vaccinees and repeat vaccinees. Direct comparison of the influenza risk between first-time and repeat vaccinees has greater statistical power, but the limited number of first-time vaccinees is still a concern.\n",
    "The reasons driving individuals to remain unvaccinated, choose to be vaccinated for the first time, or to be vaccinated repeatedly can be associated with their risk of disease or complications. If a substantial proportion of first-time vaccinees are individuals who had influenza infection in the previous season, the natural immunity acquired with this prior infection will decrease the risk of influenza compared to repeat vaccinees and may lead to the erroneous conclusion that vaccine protection decreases with multiple doses. First-time vaccinees are necessarily younger than repeat vaccinees and their immunological background may differ in terms of the first influenza virus encountered (imprinting), lifetime number of natural infections, and the overall influenza antibody landscape [ Citation 42 ]. The usual adjustment for age using continuous or dummy variables may not completely address this problem and residual confounding may persist.\n",
    "Misclassification of vaccination status can occur from both self-report and immunization registries. The potential impact of this misclassification will be greater for studies that assess individual vaccination status over multiple seasons compared to a single season. Self-report is likely to be accurate for the current season and at least one prior season [ Citation 37 ], as well as for individuals with more habitual vaccination patterns, but may be subject to recall bias for more distant seasons and for individuals with irregular vaccinations. For first-time vaccinees and irregularly vaccinated individuals, the magnitude of misclassification from self-report is unclear. Immunization registries are incomplete and may not contain all relevant current or prior vaccination records, contributing to greater misclassification for missing vaccination when used to classify vaccination status over multiple seasons. Misclassification will be mostly non-differential between influenza cases and test-negative controls, driving any association toward the null value and underestimating differences in risk between different groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\n",
    "Epidemiological analyses of repeat immunization must consider the classical host–agent–environment triad: immunological landscapes that vary by age, birth cohort, and jurisdiction (host), vaccine strains (agent), and antigenic drift of circulating viruses (environment). Pooling VE over several years for single season vaccinees vs. repeat vaccinees assumes that vaccines with different antigenic profiles have the same immunologic effects in populations with variable immunological landscapes and different circulating viruses, a far-fetched assumption. Pooling VE within a specific influenza season controls for the effect of vaccine updates, but it does not eliminate differences in immunological landscape and characteristics of circulating strains/clades in different jurisdictions. Overall, pooling will tend to mask important variability and diminish the overall magnitude of repeat vaccination effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "===== 8.  Expert commentary =====\n",
    "After more than four decades since concerns were initially raised about repeat vaccination effects, the magnitude and mechanisms remain poorly understood. During this time, the target groups recommended for annual vaccination have expanded in many countries and now include nearly all citizens in the US and most parts of Canada. The multiseason randomized clinical trial during the 1980s did not provide definitive answers [ Citation 9 ], and concerns resurfaced after the 2009 pandemic when VE studies began to assess repeat vaccination effects. Similar to findings in the 1970s and 1980s, more recent observational studies from 2010–2011 through 2014–2015 show variable effects but suggest that repeat vaccination may adversely affect vaccine-induced serological response and effectiveness in some seasons, particularly for H3N2. This is generally consistent with multiple studies demonstrating that repeated vaccination can blunt the HI antibody response to vaccine strains.\n",
    "Our systematic review and meta-analysis covered a relatively short time period, and there were few studies that met our inclusion criteria. Most analyses of repeated vaccination were conducted as a secondary analysis, and the precision of the estimates was low. In addition to the small number of studies and small sample sizes by vaccination group, there was heterogeneity in study design, patient population, study setting, vaccination type and ascertainment, age groups, and seasons. Not surprisingly, we found substantial heterogeneity in repeated vaccination effects. Heterogeneity of repeated vaccination effects is plausible given the variability of the immunological landscape in different age groups and populations and given variability in the relatedness between successive vaccine components and the circulating strain, by season and subtype. The antigenic distance hypothesis predicts variability even in the context of a single prior season’s antigenic exposures, but the actual immune response is undoubtedly far more complex. Pooling of VE estimates across multiple seasons can mask important differences at the individual season level, and studies conducted in only three or four seasons are inadequate to understand repeated vaccination effects that may be positive, negative, or neutral for any given season, subtype, or population subgroup.\n",
    "Within the limited number of seasons assessed, the signal of concern was greatest for H3N2. The pooled effect of repeated vaccination for H3N2 was driven by the 2014–2015 season when there was a major antigenic drift in the epidemic strain and the vaccine strain was unchanged from the prior year. In that context, two of three studies identified negative interference and in one of these studies there was an increased risk in repeat vaccinees; the difference between repeat and single season vaccine groups was statistically significant. Also during the 2014–2015 season, a study in Italy found a significantly increased influenza risk (negative VE) in a population where repeated vaccination was common, but VE was not reported separately for single season vaccination and repeated vaccination [ Citation 55 ]. This study was therefore not included in the meta-analysis.\n",
    "The antigenic distance model predicts a higher attack rate in repeat vs. first-time vaccinees when v1≈v2 and v1 ≠ e. Although blunting of cross-protection should be greater with homologous vaccines and greater antigenic drift, the original antigenic distance model did not assess scenarios with homologous vaccine components and a high level of mismatch comparable to 2014–2015 (v–e > 3). During the other two recent seasons (2011–2012 and 2012–2013) for which non-homologous H3N2 vaccine antigens were used in prior and current seasons, the effects of repeated vaccination were less consistent or pronounced and none showed significant variation by vaccine group.\n",
    "The egg-based manufacturing process can introduce antigenically important mutations in high-growth reassortant viruses used for vaccine production [ Citation 25 ]. The long-term immune effects of repeated exposure to egg-adapted vaccine strains that do not exactly match circulating strains and of blocking natural infection in healthy individuals with a low risk of influenza complications are unknown. The public health impact of repeated immunization and the immunologic mechanisms leading to reduced protection or increased risk remain poorly understood, and a major research effort is justified given the substantial disease burden associated with influenza (especially H3N2), the large public investment in influenza vaccination programs, and the need to maintain public confidence in vaccines. Our current understanding of repeated vaccination effects is inadequate to inform vaccine policy recommendations, but future research may shed light on the optimal strategies for vaccine strain updates and/or vaccination intervals in different age cohorts and populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "===== 9.  Five-year view =====\n",
    "An increase in basic and applied research is needed over the next 5 years to gain greater understanding of immunologic mechanisms and clinical significance of repeated vaccination effects. The emerging field of ‘systems vaccinology’ has the potential to identify T cell, B cell, and transcriptional factors that distinguish the responses to a single vaccine and repeated vaccination [ Citation 56 ]. Most influenza vaccines are derived from egg-adapted high-growth reassortant viruses, and the contribution of egg-induced mutations to repeated vaccination effects should be elucidated. In addition, animal and computational investigations suggest that some adjuvanted vaccines may reduce or eliminate original antigenic sin effects [ Citation 50 , Citation 57 , Citation 58 ]. Additional research is needed to understand mechanisms and determine if this may be observed in a sustainable way in humans.\n",
    "Large-scale, multiseason community cohort studies were conducted more than 30 years ago to understand the epidemiology of influenza [ Citation 59 ]. Since that time there have been advances in molecular diagnostic tests, changes in vaccine policies, and greater understanding of antigenic and genetic evolution of influenza viruses. There is a compelling need for new multiseason studies that will include detailed assessment of vaccine immune response (including B cell and T cell), and active surveillance for RT-PCR-confirmed influenza in children and adults who have received a single dose or repeated annual vaccine doses. The detailed genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating variants in relation to vaccine strains (both egg- and cell-passaged) will be important to document annually in order to assess whether results are consistent with the antigenic distance hypothesis, and/or to formulate additional hypotheses.\n",
    "Observational studies are more feasible and cost-efficient than clinical trials, but they may not provide the robust evidence needed to validate or modify vaccine policy recommendations. Given the global impact of influenza and the expansion of annual vaccination programs, there is a need for government or private foundation funding to support a large multiseason randomized trial. Due to ethical constraints, a placebo-controlled trial would be challenging to implement in countries or jurisdictions where universal annual vaccination is recommended. The trial design should take advantage of new knowledge and lessons learned since the prior clinical trial in the 1980s. Evaluation of the adaptive immune response to single and repeated vaccination should include modern immunological concepts and assays, including anti-HA stalk and neuraminidase antibodies, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and measures of epitope-specific T and B cell response. The study should be sufficiently powered to detect significant positive or negative interference from repeat vaccination in a single season of moderate to high severity. Given the unpredictability of influenza seasons, enrollment and randomization should be planned for five or more seasons to achieve a high probability of success.\n",
    "It is possible that changes in vaccine technology, including development of a universal vaccine, could fundamentally alter influenza vaccine program options in the coming decade and reduce concerns about repeated vaccination effects [ Citation 60 ]. Even in this optimistic scenario, the knowledge gained regarding influenza immune response will be valuable, and it will be critical if inactivated egg-based vaccines continue to be used by vaccination programs in many countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "===== Key issues =====\n",
    "Observational studies conducted after the 2009 pandemic show variable effects but suggest that repeat vaccination may adversely affect vaccine-induced protection in some seasons, particularly for H3N2. Interpretation is limited by the short time frame, limited number of studies, and high heterogeneity in some VE estimates. Pooling of VE estimates across multiple seasons can mask important differences at the individual season level, and studies conducted since 2009 are inadequate to guide program or policy recommendations at this time. Few studies have assessed the effects of repeated vaccination across multiple seasons, but these suggest that vaccine effectiveness may be influenced by vaccination patterns over at least several seasons. Immunonogenicity studies indicate that repeated vaccination can blunt the HI antibody response against H3N2, even after adjusting for prevaccination titer. A more detailed understanding of the immunological basis for vaccine-induced protection is needed. The antigenic distance hypothesis provides a simplified theoretical framework for understanding the immunological effects of repeated vaccination, but the model considers only two vaccine exposures. The long term immunological effects of repeated exposure to egg-adapted vaccine strains that do not exactly match circulating strains, and of blocking natural infection in healthy individuals with a low risk of influenza complications are unknown. These questions merit further investigation, particularly since annual vaccination is recommended for healthy working age adults in much of North America. An increase in basic and applied research is needed over the next decade. Multiseason clinical studies should include both observational (cohort) studies and a randomized clinical trial. These studies should incorporate modern immunological concepts and assays, including HA stalk and NA antibodies, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and measures of epitope-specific T and B cell response. The findings from these studies will be important to guide future influenza vaccine policies and recommendations.\n",

    "We identified 4636 unduplicated publications and selected 183 for full-text review for eligibility ( Figure 4 ). Eighteen studies met the eligibility criteria [ Citation 4 , Citation 13 , Citation 16 – Citation 31 ]. Of these, one study was restricted to hospitalized patients and was therefore excluded from the meta-analysis [ Citation 31 ]. All studies originated in the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority from North America ( Table 2 ). Most (82%) studies enrolled outpatients with medically attended acute respiratory illness, 1 enrolled both outpatients and inpatients, and 2 enrolled participants from the community in a household cohort study. The 17 publications included 31 sets (current only, prior only, and both seasons) of VE estimates that included unrestricted age groups. Characteristics of included studies by season, subtype, and age group are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Table 2.

    "VE estimates were consistently lowest for H3N2 across all vaccine groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in repeat vaccination effects within and between seasons and subtypes. When negative effects of prior vaccination were observed, they were most pronounced for H3N2, notably driven by two studies in the 2014–2015 season. The pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution since the antigenic relatedness of vaccine and virus strains varies by season and subtype.\n",
    "H3N2 VE estimates by current and prior vaccination status were available from seven studies and three seasons, including 2011–2012 ( n = 2), 2012–2013 ( n = 2), and 2014–2015 ( n = 3). The vaccine strain was unchanged in two of these seasons (2011–2012 and 2014–2015). There was evidence of antigenic mismatch with the vaccine strain in two seasons. In 2012–2013, circulating viruses were well matched to the WHO cell-propagated reference strain, but antigenic mismatch occurred from mutations in high-growth reassortant viruses used for vaccine manufacturing [ Citation 25 ]. In 2014–2015, the vaccine reference strain was poorly matched to the dominant circulating strain from a new antigenic cluster [ Citation 32 ]. Studies were contributed from Canada ( n = 3), the US ( n = 3), and European multi-country ( n = 1).\n",
    "In general, H3N2 estimates were highest for vaccination in the current season only. Pooled estimates for H3N2 were 39%, 17%, and 9%, respectively, for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination ( Figure 5 ). The pooled VE was statistically significant (i.e. greater than zero) for current season vaccination only; pooled VE was not significant for repeated vaccination. However, heterogeneity was high for vaccination in current season only ( I = 73%, p = .003) and in both prior and current season ( I = 86%, p < .0001) suggesting important underlying variability for which pooled analysis may not be appropriate. Conversely, the observation of no residual protection from prior season vaccination was more consistent, with lower heterogeneity ( I = 48%, p = .1). Of note, two of three studies reported pronounced difference between repeated versus current season only vaccination during the 2014–2015 season [ Citation 28 , Citation 30 ], and this difference was statistically significant in one study [ Citation 28 ]. Vaccine strains were unchanged and there was well-recognized mismatch between vaccine and epidemic strains, a pattern consistent with the antigenic distance hypothesis. However, this difference was not observed in the 2014–2015 U.S. Flu VE Network Study which had more influenza cases with repeated vaccination and single season vaccination than the other two studies combined [ Citation 13 ].

    "H1N1pdm09 VE estimates by current and prior season vaccination status were available from ten studies and four seasons, including 2010–2011 ( n = 5), 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2013–2014 ( n = 3), and 2014–2015 ( n = 1). Studies were contributed from more diverse countries than for H3N2, including Canada ( n = 3), Spain ( n = 2), the US ( n = 2), Finland ( n = 1), the UK ( n = 1), and European multi-country ( n = 1). Recommended vaccine strains were identical across all seasons ( Table 3 ) and considered antigenically similar to circulating H1N1pdm09 viruses across this period despite the emergence of a new genetic variant (clade 6B) in 2013 [ Citation 27 ]. It is noteworthy that studies included a mix of countries that had used mostly AS03-adjuvanted monovalent H1N1pdm09 vaccine in response to the 2009 pandemic (e.g. Canada, Finland, Spain, or UK), or exclusively non-adjuvanted product (e.g. US), or a combination (e.g. multi-country European study). The impact of adjuvanted monovalent vaccine use on the magnitude or duration of repeated vaccination effects is unknown. Prior to 2013–2014, H1N1pdm09 estimates were contributed solely from outside the US and were generally higher for repeat vaccinees than current season only vaccine recipients, with suggestion also of substantial residual protection from prior season vaccination.

    "Pooled estimates in 2010–2011 for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination were 54%, 69%, and 61%, respectively ( Figure 6 ). These were each statistically significant relative to no vaccination. Conversely, studies from Canada and the US in 2013–2014 showed similar or slightly lower VE among persons repeatedly vaccinated vs. those vaccinated in the current season only; VE was lower but still significant for those vaccinated only in the prior (2012–2013) season. In the overall pooled analysis across all seasons, heterogeneity was high for repeated vaccination ( I = 69%, p = .002), with more consistency in findings for vaccination in the current season only ( I = 0%, p = .9) or prior season only ( I = 40%, p = .1).

    "Influenza B VE estimates by current and prior vaccination history were available for both lineages (combined) from five studies and four seasons including 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2012–2013 ( n = 1), 2013–2014 ( n = 1), and 2014–2015 ( n = 2). Lineage-specific estimates for B/Yamagata were available from six studies and four seasons including 2011–2012 ( n = 1), 2012–2013 ( n = 2), 2013–2014 ( n = 1), and 2014–2015 ( n = 2). For B/Victoria, there were only three studies involving two seasons: 2011–2012 ( n = 1) and 2012–2013 ( n = 2). Influenza B studies were contributed from Canada ( n = 10), the US ( n = 3), and European multi-country ( n = 1).\n",
    "Quadrivalent inactivated vaccines containing both B lineages were first licensed in the US in 2013, but most vaccines administered during the study period were trivalent and contained only one B lineage. The same B/Victoria lineage strain (Brisbane/60/2008) was included as trivalent vaccine component from 2009–2010 to 2011–2012, and a B/Yamagata lineage was included from 2012–2013 through 2014–2015 ( Table 3 ). There was circulation of both lineages in 2011–2012 and 2012–2013, whereas the B/Yamagata lineage dominated in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 with clade variation relative to vaccine in both seasons.\n",
    "VE estimates for B overall were similar or slightly higher for repeat vaccination compared to current season only during 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 seasons of mixed lineage circulation, but were lower during 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 seasons of lineage-matched (B/Yamagata) but clade-mismatched circulation ( Figure 7 ). Consequently, pooling across the four seasons resulted in overall minimal differences between the two vaccine groups for influenza B. Pooled estimates for type B were 61%, 55%, and 25%, respectively, for current season only, current and prior season, and prior season only vaccination. The lineage-level analysis demonstrated a similar pattern for B/Yamagata in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015, with lower VE estimates in repeat vaccinees. With so few studies and seasons, a pattern for B/Victoria is difficult to discern. Figure 7. Vaccine effectiveness for type B (all), B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria studies without age restriction.

    "2. Methods\n",
    "The study was conducted utilising the Delphi-type technique to generate group consensus between July and December 2020. The procedure involved a two-stage survey of expert opinion on the impact of antigenic drift and egg adaptation changes on vaccine match (VM) and effectiveness (IVE) and their frequency between the 2014 and 2019 influenza seasons in the EU5 countries. These data were complemented with two systematic literature reviews focused on influenza VM and IVE (for the identical period).\n",
    "2.1. Systematic Literature Reviews\n",
    "Two literature reviews were performed, which followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [31]. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted for the research question “Influenza vaccine match (TIVs (Trivalent Influenza Vaccines)) and QIVs (Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines)) to circulating viruses between 2014–2019”. A second SLR addressed the research question “Effectiveness of TIV and QIV influenza vaccine in seasons 2014–2019”. The included articles reported European findings on IVE and VM, being original research, surveillance and sentinel data, systematic literature reviews and metanalyses, in English. Studies on non-egg-based vaccines, RCT’s, laboratory experiments, and non-European or non-human influenza viruses were excluded in the process of the SLR. The bibliographic searches were carried out using the PubMed database. Other public health websites, such as Eurosurveillance, I-MOVE, ECDC, WHO), Robert-Koch institute, GOV.UK, Sante publique France, Institut Pasteur/National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, and the Instituto de Salud Carlos III/Sistema de Vigilancia de la Gripe en España were also searched for relevant publications. Literature reviews of the search results were performed by two analysts and restricted to studies published in English, specific to influenza seasons between 2014/15 and 2018/19 and regarding only traditional TIV and QIV influenza vaccines. Additional reviews of publications provided by the experts to support responses provided in survey rounds one and two were completed systematically by a single analyst (a virologist). Data collected included influenza vaccine match or mismatch against circulating strains (including a percentage of match/mismatch, when presented), report of antigenic drift or egg adaptation changes, and measurement of vaccine effectiveness.\n",
    "2.2. Assessment of Expert Opinion\n",
    "Eleven European influenza experts from five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) were invited to participate in the study via professional networks. The inclusion criteria for the experts were: background and expertise in Public Health, Epidemiology of influenza or Virology, and/or peer-review publications or membership to relevant organisations.\n",
    "In the first survey round (using open-ended questions), experts were asked to provide a mean estimate of the increase of influenza VM and IVE in the absence of antigenic drift or egg adaptations. The responses of each expert were specific to their country and regarded only influenza seasons between 2014 and 2019. The experts were also asked to provide the frequency of the impact of these phenomena on vaccine match and effectiveness for the same period. The answers from all experts were processed using summary statistics to produce estimates at both the country level and European level. In the second survey round, experts were presented with both sets of estimates (country and European levels) and were allowed to revise their responses accordingly. Answers to the second survey were combined utilising summary statistics at country and EU5 level, as well as the EU5 averages estimated by experts for individual countries.\n",
    "An estimated percentage increase in vaccine effectiveness was calculated as an absolute increase (IVE in the absence of antigenic drift, or egg adaptation IVE in the presence of both antigenic drift and egg adaptations). A percentage increase in VM was similarly calculated as an absolute increase. Summary statistics such as mean, and range (minimum, maximum) were used to present the average percentage increase.\n",

    "Because of the age-related immune system decline, 2 potentiated influenza vaccines were specifically licensed for the elderly: Fluad®, an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM-MF59), and Intanza 15mcg®, a non adjuvanted vaccine administered intradermally (ID). The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of studies that evaluated antibody responses in the elderly following immunization with IM-MF59 or ID vaccines. The two potentiated vaccines induced immune responses satisfying, in most instances, the European Medicine Agency immunogenicity criteria, both against vaccine antigens and heterovariant drifted strains. Considering pooled data reported in the articles analyzed and papers directly comparing the 2 vaccines, the antibody responses elicited by IM-MF59 and ID were found to be generally comparable.

    "Annual influenza infection is a major cause of substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly and in the other risk groups. According to previous reports in the USA, the number of annual influenza-associated hospitalizations in each influenza season between 1979 and 2001 ranged from 55,000 to 431,000, Citation and 90% of the 36,000 annual influenza-associated respiratory and circulatory-related deaths occurred in the 1990s among persons older than 65. Citation Influenza vaccines represent the major tool to reduce the burden of the disease. However, despite a high vaccination rate, vaccine efficacy among elderly is lower than among healthy adults. Citation The weakened immune response observed in elderly people, defined as immunosenescence, Citation is considered to be one of the main reason of the higher risk for influenza-related complications that could lead to hospitalization and death and of the reduced efficacy of influenza vaccination. The reduced immunogenicity and effectiveness of influenza vaccines in subjects with higher risk of influenza-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths, led the innovative drive to search for new strategies to implement the immune response elicited by plain influenza vaccines.

    "===== Characteristics of the Two\tEnhanced Vaccines: Fluad® and Intanza 15mcg® =====\n",
    "Fluad® (Novartis Vaccines, Italy) is an MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine, licensed in Italy in 1997, and administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle (IM-MF59). It is an inactivated subunit vaccine containing the standard dosage of 15 μg in each 0.5 ml dose of highly-purified influenza surface haemagglutinin (HA) antigen per strain and an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene, a naturally occurring biodegradable and biocompatible substance, found in the liver in a wide range of species, including humans. Citation The aim of the MF59 adjuvant is to increase the vaccine immunogenicity. Citation The mechanism of action of MF59 is not fully understood. Initially it was thought that the enhance of protection might be due to a depot effect: delivering the antigen in an oil-in-water emulsion would result into a slow release of the antigen and a more effective priming of the immune system. Indeed MF59 emulsion was found to induce a local immune-stimulatory environment, which is able to optimize the activation of the innate immune response at the injection site, by recruiting and activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs). APCs acquire an increased ability to capture, transport and process co-administered antigens from the peripheral tissues to local lymph nodes and consequently, stimulate an effective adaptive memory immune response specific to the vaccine. Citation\n",
    "Intanza 15mcg® (Sanofi Pasteur MSD SNC, France) is a split trivalent non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID) which uses an innovative microinjection system (Soluvia, Becton Dickinson, USA) and has been available in Italy since the Winter season 2010–2011. The manufacturing processing is based on that used for the intramuscular seasonal vaccine although a lower volume is used for intradermal vaccine (15 μg HA/strain per 0.1 ml instead of 0.5 ml). Intradermal vaccination is a more efficient route for influenza vaccines Citation and is supposed to increase vaccine immunogenicity by reliably delivering the vaccine into the immune-rich environment of the dermis where the presence of a high density of lymphatic and capillary vessels facilitates a direct contact between administered antigens and immune system. Citation The exact mechanisms involved in intradermal immunization are not fully understood, however, it is known that skin generates both innate and adaptive immune system responses. Two types of professional APCs (Langherans cells in the epidermis and dermal dendritic cells (DCs) in the dermis) play a pivotal role in skin's innate immune response and induction of adaptive immune response against pathogens. Citation These DCs favor rapid capture and movement of antigen via lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes, thus facilitating lymph node T and B cells activation/expansion and induction of antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity. Citation Antigens can also drain into the lymph nodes with no involvement of peripheral tissue DCs and be captured by lymph node resident DCs from skin migratory DCs, with subsequent priming of naïve T cells. Citation\n",
    "Clearly, the immune response induced by intradermal antigen delivery is generated by a mechanism which markedly differs from that of the intramuscular route. Citation\n",
    "The deep muscle is relatively inefficient in capturing antigens by immune cells, and only circulating DCs are able to capture antigens and migrate to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatic conduits or bloodstream. Vaccine antigens delivered to the skin are more likely to be captured by resident APCs, such as Langherans cells and dermal DCs, and transported to the draining lymph nodes for B cells to respond.\n",
    "IM-MF59 and ID influenza vaccines were repetitively examined for safety and tolerability in clinical trials. Although a number of results were available, 2 meta-analysis on IM-MF59 Citation and 2 randomized controlled trials on ID Citation including safety data in adults >60 y of age with and without underlying diseases were identified. These studies included trials comparing IM-MF59 or ID with non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines; however we considered results concerning the 2 potentiated vaccines only. The analysis of solicited local and systemic reactions that occurred 0/3–7 d after vaccination revealed a constant rate in subjects receiving IM-MF59 or ID, generally higher as compared with volunteers receiving a conventional influenza vaccine. However, the majority of solicited reactions were local, and mild or moderate in intensity both after IM-MF59 Citation and ID. Citation Recently, 2 different studies carried out by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation directly compared, in addition to immunogenicity, safety and tolerability, of IM-MF59 and ID in the elderly. Adverse events in the first 3 d post-vaccination were similar for the 2 vaccines and symptoms were mild to moderate. Injection–site reactions assessed in the first 6–7 d post-vaccination confirmed previous data and appeared to be more common in the ID group as compared with IM-MF59 group. Erythema or local inflammation were the most frequent symptoms among ID recipients and were reported in 63.1% by Van Damme et al. Citation and in 76.2% by Scheifele et al. Citation of ID volunteers, as compared with 13.4% and 13.0% of the IM-MF59 recipients, respectively. The percentages of people showing swelling and induration were lower but again more frequent following injection of ID than IM-MF59. Comparing ID with IM-MF59, swelling was found in 34.2% vs. 8.6% Citation and 49.2% vs. 12.0% Citation and induration in 32.9% vs. 10.6% Citation and 46.5% vs. 8.0%, Citation respectively. Injection site pain seemed to be similar between IM-MF59 and ID groups in the data reported by Van Damme et al. Citation (20.9% vs. 19.8%) and slightly higher in the IM-MF59 group as reported by Scheifele et al. (37.9% vs. 29.7%). Citation Systemic adverse events were generally mild, transient and similar between the two groups.\n",

    "===== Serological Criteria for Influenza Vaccine Evaluation =====\n",
    "For influenza vaccines there are protection correlates that although being imperfect are based on immunological criteria shared by the international scientific community and regulatory agencies that recognize that serological immune criteria may support the approval of influenza vaccines. Citation\n",
    "The ability to elicit HA strain-specific antibodies in the serum of immunized persons is the major indicator of influenza vaccine immunogenicity used for vaccine studies and licensure and a marker of protective efficacy. To date 2 different assays qualified for detection of anti-HA influenza strain-specific antibodies are used for vaccine licensure: the haemagglutination inhibiting assay (HI) and the single radial hemolysis test (SRH). Citation The HI assay is the most widely used because of its relatively simplicity. The HI test takes advantage of the influenza virus ability to agglutinate red blood cells via HA binding to sialic residues on red blood cells. Antibodies directed to HA antigen can inhibit this haemagglutination, and HI titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that inhibits haemagglutination. Different studies suggest that HI titers ≥40 can be considered as a 50% protective titer. Citation However there is the need to better define correlates of protection and there are some perplexities on the identification of a single threshold HI titer for defining protection. Citation The SRH is a different test that can be used to detect antibodies to HA, but is less frequently reported. Citation The test is based on immunodiffusion of antibodies against HA in agarose gel containing influenza virus bound to red blood cells and complement. The presence of anti-HA antibodies is detected by the lysis of red blood cells and antibody titers are measured in square millimeters (mm ) of the zone of lysis.\n",
    "Parameters including seroprotection rate (proportion of individuals achieving an HI titer of ≥40 or an SRH lysis area ≥25 mm Citation ), ratio of post-vaccination to pre-vaccination geometric mean titer values (GMTR) and seroconversion rate (proportion of individuals that have a fourfold or grater rise in HI titer or an SRH area increase >50% from pre- to post-vaccination titer, and seronegative individuals that achieve a titer of ≥40 or an SRH area ≥25 mm ) are conventionally used to estimate the advantages provided by vaccines and to support licensure of inactivated vaccines. Up to the present time, in Europe, for annual licensure to be granted for a specific influenza vaccine in the pre-defined age groups, EMA requires that post-vaccination titers against influenza HA antigens meet specific criteria. Citation For individuals ≥60 y at least one of the following values must be met for each vaccine strain: seroprotection rate ≥60%, GMTR ≥2 and seroconversion rate ≥30%. Citation\n",
    "Finally, it is important to underline that a third test, the neutralization (NT) assay, would represent a useful adjunct for detection and evaluation of antibody responses induced by influenza vaccine administration. Citation NT assay detects antibodies that inhibit virus replication and is considered to provide a more functional assessment of vaccine-induced immunity. Moreover, since in many instances it has been found to be more sensitive than HI test in detecting higher antibody titers, it might be preferable to confirm the immunogenicity data by using NT assay, Citation although to the present time NT test is not included in the assays used for vaccine licensure, since there is no known protection titer for NT antibodies.\n",

    "This review includes data from male and female subjects, aged 60 or more, immunized with influenza seasonal trivalent IM-MF59 or ID vaccine who participated in well-designed controlled clinical studies and were examined for vaccine induced antibody responses.\n",
    "A systematic search for studies published from 1999 to 2014 was conducted in Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, BioMED, SIGN, GIMBE, and NICE. The keywords used for the search were \"Fluad Influenza Vaccination Elderly,\", \"MF59 Influenza Vaccination Elderly,\", \"Intanza Influenza Vaccination Elderly,\", \"Intradermal Influenza Vaccination Elderly,\", \"Influenza Vaccines,\", \"Influenza vaccine immunogenicity.\", To identify the studies to include in our systematic review, we followed the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Citation The relevance of the references identified was evaluated independently by the authors by reading the titles and the abstracts. The full papers of the articles considered relevant were then obtained.\n",
    "Twenty five studies were included in this review. Citation Citation These studies recruited subjects who would normally be candidates for routine seasonal influenza vaccination and the strain composition of the influenza vaccines used conformed to the yearly requirements of the World Health Organization. The population consisted of elderly subjects with and without underlying diseases, Citation Citation Citation with unknown health status Citation or healthy. Citation Citation No sub-analyses were conducted to evaluate potential differences in the outcome between these groups.\n",
    "The studies were prevalently conducted with the aim of comparing the 2 enhanced vaccines with conventional vaccines. However, in this review we considered only immunogenicity data of the 2 potentiated vaccines. Although in the absence of a standardization of the existing assays, the homologous and heterologous HI antibody responses induced by IM-MF59 and ID in people aged ≥60 y were explored as reported in the studies reviewed, considering if EMA immunogenicity criteria were satisfied. Citation Since results from some of the studies were reported as figures instead of numerical data, only the fulfillment, if any, of EMA requirements was considered. In the description of the results obtained, when we reported the range of the values observed we considered only studies showing numerical data.\n",

Immunogenicity of ID influenza vaccine against homologous vaccine strains in volunteers 60 y of age and older Download CSV Display Table As reported in Table 1 , 25 studies on immune response of people aged ≥60 y after immunization with seasonal IM-MF59 were included in our systematic review for a total of 3492 subjects for A/H3N2 antigen, 3396 for A/H1N1 and 3545 for B antigen. One of the studies evaluated the results over a period of 3 winter seasons. Citation Three trials examined responses against A/H3N2 strain only Citation and one against B strain only. Citation The results of 13 clinical trials, representing an integrated development program of the manufacture, for a total of 2012 subjects vaccinated with IM-MF59 and 1498 with a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine, reported in 2 meta-analyses Citation were not considered since results were reported as pooled analyses and expressed as IM-MF59 to comparator ratio. However, data from some of the 25 trials herein considered Citation are included in the 2 meta-analyses. For all the 25 trials, with a few exceptions, it was possible to examine numerical data or only fulfillment or not of EMA requirements for elderly people for post-vaccination seroprotection rate, GMTR (except for Baldo 2006 Citation ), and seroconversion rate (except for Del Giudice et al. 2006 Citation and Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation ). Protective HI titers higher than the generally accepted value of 40 were considered by Minutello et al. Citation and De Donato et al. Citation (HI ≥128) and Gasparini et al. (HI ≥160). Citation With regard to responses against A/H3N2 antigen, the requested post-vaccination value of at least 60% of people with HI protective titers was always reached (range 70.8–100%) with 2 exceptions, both considering as protective titers higher than 40, Minutello et al. Citation (third year of observation, 51%) and Gasparini et al. Citation (51%). The requested values of GMTR (≥2) and of seroconversion (≥30%) were always satisfied and ranged from 2.4 to 17.6 and from 30.0 to 92.9%, respectively. The examination of HI titers against A/H1N1 antigen showed that the values of seroprotection were >60% (range 71.6–100%) with the exclusion of the first year of observation for Minutello et al. Citation (22.0%, protective titers ≥128) and for Basileo et al. Citation (40.1%), the values of GMTR >2 (range 2.1–13.7) except for Minutello et al. Citation (1.8, third year of observation) and Gasparini et al. Citation (1.9). The requested value of at least 30% of seroconversion was not reached in 6 instances Citation with percentages ranging from 20.0 to 28.3%, whereas when the percentages were satisfied, they ranged from 32.0 to 94.4%. The responses against B antigen were somewhat lower since the 60% of seroprotected individuals in 7 of the studies (range 35.7–58.2%) Citation and the 30% of seroconversions in 6 of the trials (range 10.0–26.9%) Citation were not reached. When the requested criteria were satisfied the percentages of seroprotected individuals ranged from 63.0 to 100% and seroconversion percentages ranged from 32.8 to 89.0%. The GMTR was always >2 (range 2.1–16.2) with 3 exceptions, Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation (1.8), Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation (1.6). Considering all the studies examined, the results obtained showed that IM-MF59 vaccine met, as requested, in most instances 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria. The worst, but still acceptable results, were obtained by Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen and by Minutello et al. Citation the third year of observation and by Scheifele et al. Citation and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation against B antigen, when only one of the EMA criteria was satisfied. Table 2 reports HI antibody responses induced following administration of ID vaccine using BD's Soluvia to volunteers aged ≥60 y in the 9 different clinical studies considered in the present review. Citation Citation In the study by Arnou et al. Citation the results over 3 consecutive years were reported and in one study (Ansaldi et al. 2012 Citation ) only the results for A/H3N2 strain were included. The total number of subjects examined was 5035 for A/H3N2 and 5100 for A/H1N1 and B antigens. Some of the clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of different doses of Intanza® and compared the results with other vaccines; however, in our review only the results obtained with Intanza 15mcg® were examined. All the studies satisfied the 3 EMA criteria for the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, with the exception of Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen when only the GMTR value was met. For results satisfying EMA requirements, the seroprotection rate ranged from 71.0 to 98.1% and from 63.0 to 93.1%; the GMTR from 2.6 and 8.2 and from 2.0 to 8.1 and, finally, seroconversion from 33.7 to 71.8% and from 35.2 to 76.3%, respectively for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens. As found for IM-MF59, the HI antibody response induced by B strain was lower. The required 60% of seroprotected volunteers was reached in only some of the studies reporting the results for B strain with values ranging from 66.1 to 100%. Values below 60% were found in the first and second year of Arnou et al. Citation (55.7 and 59.9%, respectively) and in Van Damme et al. Citation The GMTR was in most instances >2 (range 2.5 and 3.7) except in the second year of Arnou et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Tsang et al. Citation (1.7) studies. Seroconversion rates >30% were found in 6 trials (range 36.4–46.0%). The values of the studies that did not satisfy EMA criteria Citation ranged from 15.8 to 17.2%. In all the years studied, 3 or at least 2 of the EMA immunogenicity criteria were satisfied, except the second year of the study by Arnou et al. Citation when none of the immunogenicity criteria was satisfied and the studies conducted by Van Damme et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation and Tsang et al. Citation when only one value was reached. However, Van Damme et al., Citation and Scheifele et al., Citation measured antibody titers using both HI and SRH methods. The study by Van Damme et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using SRH satisfied all 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria not only against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, confirming data observed using HI method, but also against B antigen, against which only one of the 3 criteria was satisfied using HI test. On the other hand, the study of Scheifele et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using HI method satisfied all 3 EMA criteria against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and only one against B strain. Conversely, by using SRH method the fulfilled criteria were 2 against A strains and the same one against B strain. A direct comparison of immunogenicity of IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, measuring antibody titers both using HI and SRH methods, was recently reported by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation who examined elderly people immunized for 2007/2008 and for 2011/2012 Winter seasons, respectively. Van Damme et al. Citation found that there were no differences between the 2 vaccine groups in GMTR, seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains by either HI or SRH method with the exception of seroprotection rate for the A/H1N1 strain. Seroprotection rates were high in both groups, but significantly higher in the IM-MF59 group (differences of 5.8% (0.7–10.9) and 5.8% (1.1–10.5) by HI and SRH method respectively). Moreover, considering an arbitrary definition of non-inferiority (upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals around the post-vaccination ratios of GMT IM-MF59/ID being <1.5), Van Damme et al. Citation demonstrated GMT non inferiority of ID vs. IM-MF59 vaccine for A/H1N1 and B strains with HI method and for all 3 strains with SRH method. In addition, post-hoc analysis to adjust for baseline antibody titers demonstrated ID vaccine non-inferiority using both HI and SRH methods for all 3 strains. Scheifele et al. Citation found that 21 d after vaccination seroprotection rates and GMT values were significantly higher after IM-MF59 vaccine vs. ID vaccine both against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains when measured by HI and SRH methods, with the exception of seroprotection rates against A/H1N1 measured by SRH method that were similar in the 2 vaccine groups. However, the differences although being statistically significant, were modest. Meaningful response assessment against B vaccine strain was not possible due to the presence of very high baseline titers. Using the same arbitrary definition of non-inferiority used by Van Damme et al, Citation Scheifele et al. Citation found that HI responses against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for ID relative to IM-MF59 vaccine, whereas the results were similar to all 3 vaccine antigens when assessed by SRH. Results obtained by our research group comparing the immunogenicity evaluated as HI antibody induction of IM-MF59 and ID in elderly institutionalized volunteers during the 2011–2012 Citation and the 2012–2013 Citation Winter seasons were recently published. The results observed in the 2011–2012 Winter season, the same examined by Scheifele et al., Citation showed that against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens both vaccines induced significant comparable increases in HI titers and the responses satisfied all 3 EMA requirements. Against B strain both vaccines stimulated responses lower as compared with the A antigens, moreover the responses were generally higher after ID than IM-MF59 and all 3 EMA criteria were met after ID and only one (seroprotection rate) after IM-MF59. Considering the results of the 2012–2013 winter season Citation both vaccines induced comparable significant HI antibody responses against the 3 vaccine strains. All three EMA criteria were satisfied against A/H3N2 and B antigens, whereas responses against A/H1N1 antigen were somewhat lower since only one criteria was met with both vaccines. Responses against B antigen tended to be higher in subjects vaccinated with ID than those immunized with IM-MF59 vaccine again, as observed in the Winter 2011–2012. Citation Finally, in order to try to have more information about possible differences between IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, immunogenicity data reported for the 2 vaccines in the different studies analyzed in this review were compared. Because of the different years in which IM-MF59 and ID vaccines were commercialized, 1997 and 2010 respectively, the years examined, the vaccine composition and the number of people studied, differ between the 2 vaccines. In order to analyze if differences between the pooled data from the studies analyzed for the 2 vaccines were significant statistically, an hypothesis test was applied. In particular, because of the differences in the data available and because the standard deviation values of the immunogenicity values were prevalently missing, a 2-samples pooled t-test at the α = 5% significance level was selected as the most appropriate hypothesis test. The mean and confidence interval values estimated for the 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria (seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion) are reported in Figure 1 . Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

    "Immunogenicity of FLUAD and INTANZA 15mcg® in elderly people: heterologous responses In addition to the suboptimal immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in elderly people, another important limitation of influenza vaccination, during the inter-pandemic periods, is a direct consequence of the antigenic drift due to the accumulation of point mutations on genes encoding the 2 surface proteins, HA and neuraminidase, resulting in changes in the antigenic characteristics of the circulating strains, possibly determining significant mismatches between the latter and the viral variants included in the vaccine, with consequent inadequate protection of vaccines. Citation The availability of influenza vaccines offering a higher and broader immune response than that conferred by conventional formulations could represent a fundamental challenge in the prevention of influenza. Table 3 reports data demonstrating that IM-MF59-adjuvanted and ID vaccines have been found reproducibly to confer cross-reactivity against drifted virus strains in the elderly patients aged ≥60. Citation Citation HI antibody responses against A/H3N2 co-circulating during the winter period studied Citation and A/H3N2 strains recommended as vaccine component for previous or forthcoming winter seasons Citation were found to fulfill in most instances all the 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria both after IM-MF59 Citation or ID Citation vaccine administration. Similar results were obtained studying antibody responses induced by IM-MF59 Citation or ID Citation vaccines against A/H1N1 chosen as vaccine strain for forthcoming winter season Citation or A/H1N1 circulating among the population. Citation Induction of cross-reactive HI antibodies against influenza B virus strain was examined only after IM-MF59 vaccination in 3 different studies. Citation Influenza B viruses fall in 2 major antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, co-circulating in some years among the population and currently in many countries only one type B strain, representing one of the 2 lineages, can be incorporated into the vaccine. Citation Increases in HI antibody titers were found against drifted B strains, both belonging to the same or different lineage as compared to vaccine strain. However, the responses prevalently satisfy, both against the vaccine and the drifted strains, only one of the 3 EMA criteria. Table 3.

In particular, because of the differences in the data available and because the standard deviation values of the immunogenicity values were prevalently missing, a 2-samples pooled t-test at the α = 5% significance level was selected as the most appropriate hypothesis test. The mean and confidence interval values estimated for the 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria (seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion) are reported in Figure 1 . Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

    "In addition to the suboptimal immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in elderly people, another important limitation of influenza vaccination, during the inter-pandemic periods, is a direct consequence of the antigenic drift due to the accumulation of point mutations on genes encoding the 2 surface proteins, HA and neuraminidase, resulting in changes in the antigenic characteristics of the circulating strains, possibly determining significant mismatches between the latter and the viral variants included in the vaccine, with consequent inadequate protection of vaccines.

    "===== Conclusions =====\n",
    "Previous published studies have established that the immune response induced by IM-MF59 and ID potentiated vaccines, specially licensed for elderly people and marketed in Italy in 1997 and 2010 respectively, can be considered higher in elderly people as compared to conventional vaccines Citation Citation Citation ; however, it is unclear if one of the 2 potentiated vaccines offers any advantages.\n",
    "In order to have more information, in this review, we examined data previously obtained and published in terms of immunogenicity, evaluated in most instances as induction of HI titers according to the 3 EMA immunogenicity requirements (i.e., seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion), studying people aged ≥60 y immunized with the 2 potentiated vaccines.\n",
    "We found evidence of a good and prevalently comparable immunogenicity profile of IM-MF59 and ID potentiated vaccines in elderly subjects both against homologous and heterologous influenza virus strains.\n",
    "The homologous responses against the 3 vaccine antigens were firstly examined considering the responses reported in the different studies examined only after IM-MF59 ( Table 1 ) or ID ( Table 2 ) vaccine administration, although other vaccine preparations were studied. We found that the EMA requirements in most instances were satisfied for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 vaccine antigens with both vaccines. The responses against the B antigen were somewhat lower, since frequently only one or 2 of the 3 EMA requirements were satisfied. The reduced responses against B influenza virus strains are in accordance with previous reports suggesting that the antibody response to inactivated conventional or potentiated vaccines is substantially lower against type B antigen than against type A antigens Citation and seem to suggest that possible strategies to control influenza B viruses should be considered separately from those of influenza A viruses. However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by the observation that the HI test is considered not to be well adapted to measure the response against B influenza viruses. Ether treatment of the viral antigen used for HI testing was found to enhance sensitivity for influenza B responses Citation but the higher HI titers observed with B strain virus treated with ether seem to be less specific and not comparable with titers obtained against A antigens not treated with ether. In the absence of international protocols or validated correlation with clinical protection, the use of ether is not considered a valid solution to the problem.\n",
    "Secondly, since the results examined were obtained in different studies, in order to compare this data, we examined the pooled results by applying the 2-sample t-test that takes into account both the different sample size of the 2 vaccines and the a-priori non-knowledge of their confidence intervals. The values of HI antibody titers against the 3 homologous vaccine antigens did not significantly differ across the 2 potentiated vaccines ( Fig. 1 ) for the 3 EMA requirements, except for the seroconversion values against A/H3N2 antigen showing a higher value after IM-MF59 administration as compared to ID vaccine.\n",
    "Thirdly, the analysis of the results of the few comparative head-to-head immunogenicity studies published in the literature to date showed that the results reported were slightly varying. An higher induction of HI antibody titers by IM-MF59 compared to ID was found by Van Damme et al. Citation against the A/H3N2 strain, but no differences were found after adjusting titers for baseline antibody, and by Scheifele et al. Citation against the 2 A strains. However, responses in the 2 studies were similar when assessed by SRH method. Citation The results of our research group Citation showed a similar immunogenicity against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and a slightly higher immunogenicity against B strain following ID administration as compared to IM-MF59 vaccine.\n",
    "Finally, some of the trials examined Citation studied the induction of heterologous HI antibody responses, i.e., responses against influenza strains not included in the vaccine used for immunization, following immunization with IM-MF59 and ID vaccines and found results generally satisfying all or at least some of the EMA requirements ( Table 3 ).\n",
    "In conclusion, data reported in this review suggest that IM-MF59 and ID vaccines might be appropriate strategies to address the challenge of declining immune responses in older people, even during seasons when antigenic drifts occur. Because of previous good safety results, despite the higher incidence of some injection-site reactions in ID vaccinated compared with IM-MF59 vaccine, Citation data reported in this review suggest that IM-MF59 and ID vaccines can provide clinicians with an opportunity to better control influenza in aged people, although, further studies and trials are desirable because of different problems.\n",
    "A significant heterogeneity was found across the studies examined for the immunogenicity outcomes. Differences between studies in terms of age, sex, health conditions and previous influenza vaccinations of the elderly volunteers immunized or the antigen vaccine composition of the vaccines used in the studies considered might have influenced the results.\n",
    "Inter-laboratory variability in serological techniques and determination was previously shown suggesting the need for improved standardization of assays and study design. Citation Immunogenicity was evaluated as the ability of vaccines to induce HI antibody responses and inter-laboratory variability for the HI assay has been previously found to be higher as compared with SRH and NT test. Citation HI titers were considered according to EMA immunogenicity criteria Citation although there are some disagreements on the identification of a single threshold (HI titer ≥40) for defining protection. Citation The HI assay has some limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity Citation and recent studies show that serum HI antibody titers may not be associated with the development of influenza. Moreover, because of the importance and difficulties of evaluating efficacy and effectiveness of vaccine administration, there is the need for studies to provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness during each season and to collect protection data from laboratory-confirmed cases (PCR or virus isolation). Additionally, the antibody response is not necessarily the best predictor of clinical efficacy in older adults Citation and because of this possible lack of correlation, further studies are necessary to evaluate cell-mediated immunity and the association of antibody and cellular responses with clinical outcomes, including the occurrence of influenza illness, hospitalizations, and mortality.\n",

    "As reported in Table 1 , 25 studies on immune response of people aged ≥60 y after immunization with seasonal IM-MF59 were included in our systematic review for a total of 3492 subjects for A/H3N2 antigen, 3396 for A/H1N1 and 3545 for B antigen. One of the studies evaluated the results over a period of 3 winter seasons. Citation Three trials examined responses against A/H3N2 strain only Citation and one against B strain only. Citation The results of 13 clinical trials, representing an integrated development program of the manufacture, for a total of 2012 subjects vaccinated with IM-MF59 and 1498 with a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine, reported in 2 meta-analyses Citation were not considered since results were reported as pooled analyses and expressed as IM-MF59 to comparator ratio. However, data from some of the 25 trials herein considered Citation are included in the 2 meta-analyses.\n",
    "For all the 25 trials, with a few exceptions, it was possible to examine numerical data or only fulfillment or not of EMA requirements for elderly people for post-vaccination seroprotection rate, GMTR (except for Baldo 2006 Citation ), and seroconversion rate (except for Del Giudice et al. 2006 Citation and Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation ). Protective HI titers higher than the generally accepted value of 40 were considered by Minutello et al. Citation and De Donato et al. Citation (HI ≥128) and Gasparini et al. (HI ≥160). Citation\n",
    "With regard to responses against A/H3N2 antigen, the requested post-vaccination value of at least 60% of people with HI protective titers was always reached (range 70.8–100%) with 2 exceptions, both considering as protective titers higher than 40, Minutello et al. Citation (third year of observation, 51%) and Gasparini et al. Citation (51%). The requested values of GMTR (≥2) and of seroconversion (≥30%) were always satisfied and ranged from 2.4 to 17.6 and from 30.0 to 92.9%, respectively.\n",
    "The examination of HI titers against A/H1N1 antigen showed that the values of seroprotection were >60% (range 71.6–100%) with the exclusion of the first year of observation for Minutello et al. Citation (22.0%, protective titers ≥128) and for Basileo et al. Citation (40.1%), the values of GMTR >2 (range 2.1–13.7) except for Minutello et al. Citation (1.8, third year of observation) and Gasparini et al. Citation (1.9). The requested value of at least 30% of seroconversion was not reached in 6 instances Citation with percentages ranging from 20.0 to 28.3%, whereas when the percentages were satisfied, they ranged from 32.0 to 94.4%.\n",
    "The responses against B antigen were somewhat lower since the 60% of seroprotected individuals in 7 of the studies (range 35.7–58.2%) Citation and the 30% of seroconversions in 6 of the trials (range 10.0–26.9%) Citation were not reached. When the requested criteria were satisfied the percentages of seroprotected individuals ranged from 63.0 to 100% and seroconversion percentages ranged from 32.8 to 89.0%.

    "Considering all the studies examined, the results obtained showed that IM-MF59 vaccine met, as requested, in most instances 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria. The worst, but still acceptable results, were obtained by Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen and by Minutello et al. Citation the third year of observation and by Scheifele et al. Citation and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation against B antigen, when only one of the EMA criteria was satisfied.\n",
    "Table 2 reports HI antibody responses induced following administration of ID vaccine using BD's Soluvia to volunteers aged ≥60 y in the 9 different clinical studies considered in the present review. Citation Citation In the study by Arnou et al. Citation the results over 3 consecutive years were reported and in one study (Ansaldi et al. 2012 Citation ) only the results for A/H3N2 strain were included. The total number of subjects examined was 5035 for A/H3N2 and 5100 for A/H1N1 and B antigens. Some of the clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of different doses of Intanza® and compared the results with other vaccines; however, in our review only the results obtained with Intanza 15mcg® were examined.\n",
    "All the studies satisfied the 3 EMA criteria for the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, with the exception of Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen when only the GMTR value was met. For results satisfying EMA requirements, the seroprotection rate ranged from 71.0 to 98.1% and from 63.0 to 93.1%; the GMTR from 2.6 and 8.2 and from 2.0 to 8.1 and, finally, seroconversion from 33.7 to 71.8% and from 35.2 to 76.3%, respectively for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens. As found for IM-MF59, the HI antibody response induced by B strain was lower. The required 60% of seroprotected volunteers was reached in only some of the studies reporting the results for B strain with values ranging from 66.1 to 100%. Values below 60% were found in the first and second year of Arnou et al. Citation (55.7 and 59.9%, respectively) and in Van Damme et al. Citation The GMTR was in most instances >2 (range 2.5 and 3.7) except in the second year of Arnou et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Tsang et al. Citation (1.7) studies. Seroconversion rates >30% were found in 6 trials (range 36.4–46.0%). The values of the studies that did not satisfy EMA criteria Citation ranged from 15.8 to 17.2%. In all the years studied, 3 or at least 2 of the EMA immunogenicity criteria were satisfied, except the second year of the study by Arnou et al. Citation when none of the immunogenicity criteria was satisfied and the studies conducted by Van Damme et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation and Tsang et al. Citation when only one value was reached. However, Van Damme et al., Citation and Scheifele et al., Citation measured antibody titers using both HI and SRH methods. The study by Van Damme et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using SRH satisfied all 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria not only against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, confirming data observed using HI method, but also against B antigen, against which only one of the 3 criteria was satisfied using HI test. On the other hand, the study of Scheifele et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using HI method satisfied all 3 EMA criteria against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and only one against B strain. Conversely, by using SRH method the fulfilled criteria were 2 against A strains and the same one against B strain.\n",
    "A direct comparison of immunogenicity of IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, measuring antibody titers both using HI and SRH methods, was recently reported by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation who examined elderly people immunized for 2007/2008 and for 2011/2012 Winter seasons, respectively.\n",
    "Van Damme et al. Citation found that there were no differences between the 2 vaccine groups in GMTR, seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains by either HI or SRH method with the exception of seroprotection rate for the A/H1N1 strain. Seroprotection rates were high in both groups, but significantly higher in the IM-MF59 group (differences of 5.8% (0.7–10.9) and 5.8% (1.1–10.5) by HI and SRH method respectively). Moreover, considering an arbitrary definition of non-inferiority (upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals around the post-vaccination ratios of GMT IM-MF59/ID being <1.5), Van Damme et al. Citation demonstrated GMT non inferiority of ID vs. IM-MF59 vaccine for A/H1N1 and B strains with HI method and for all 3 strains with SRH method. In addition, post-hoc analysis to adjust for baseline antibody titers demonstrated ID vaccine non-inferiority using both HI and SRH methods for all 3 strains.\n",
    "Scheifele et al. Citation found that 21 d after vaccination seroprotection rates and GMT values were significantly higher after IM-MF59 vaccine vs. ID vaccine both against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains when measured by HI and SRH methods, with the exception of seroprotection rates against A/H1N1 measured by SRH method that were similar in the 2 vaccine groups. However, the differences although being statistically significant, were modest. Meaningful response assessment against B vaccine strain was not possible due to the presence of very high baseline titers. Using the same arbitrary definition of non-inferiority used by Van Damme et al, Citation Scheifele et al. Citation found that HI responses against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for ID relative to IM-MF59 vaccine, whereas the results were similar to all 3 vaccine antigens when assessed by SRH.\n",
    "Results obtained by our research group comparing the immunogenicity evaluated as HI antibody induction of IM-MF59 and ID in elderly institutionalized volunteers during the 2011–2012 Citation and the 2012–2013 Citation Winter seasons were recently published. The results observed in the 2011–2012 Winter season, the same examined by Scheifele et al., Citation showed that against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens both vaccines induced significant comparable increases in HI titers and the responses satisfied all 3 EMA requirements. Against B strain both vaccines stimulated responses lower as compared with the A antigens, moreover the responses were generally higher after ID than IM-MF59 and all 3 EMA criteria were met after ID and only one (seroprotection rate) after IM-MF59. Considering the results of the 2012–2013 winter season Citation both vaccines induced comparable significant HI antibody responses against the 3 vaccine strains. All three EMA criteria were satisfied against A/H3N2 and B antigens, whereas responses against A/H1N1 antigen were somewhat lower since only one criteria was met with both vaccines. Responses against B antigen tended to be higher in subjects vaccinated with ID than those immunized with IM-MF59 vaccine again, as observed in the Winter 2011–2012. Citation\n",
    "Finally, in order to try to have more information about possible differences between IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, immunogenicity data reported for the 2 vaccines in the different studies analyzed in this review were compared. Because of the different years in which IM-MF59 and ID vaccines were commercialized, 1997 and 2010 respectively, the years examined, the vaccine composition and the number of people studied, differ between the 2 vaccines. In order to analyze if differences between the pooled data from the studies analyzed for the 2 vaccines were significant statistically, an hypothesis test was applied. In particular, because of the differences in the data available and because the standard deviation values of the immunogenicity values were prevalently missing, a 2-samples pooled t-test at the α = 5% significance level was selected as the most appropriate hypothesis test. The mean and confidence interval values estimated for the 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria (seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion) are reported in Figure 1 . Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

Citation HI titers were considered according to EMA immunogenicity criteria Citation although there are some disagreements on the identification of a single threshold (HI titer ≥40) for defining protection. Citation The HI assay has some limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity Citation and recent studies show that serum HI antibody titers may not be associated with the development of influenza. Moreover, because of the importance and difficulties of evaluating efficacy and effectiveness of vaccine administration, there is the need for studies to provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness during each season and to collect protection data from laboratory-confirmed cases (PCR or virus isolation). Additionally, the antibody response is not necessarily the best predictor of clinical efficacy in older adults Citation and because of this possible lack of correlation, further studies are necessary to evaluate cell-mediated immunity and the association of antibody and cellular responses with clinical outcomes, including the occurrence of influenza illness, hospitalizations, and mortality.\n",

    "Because of the age-related immune system decline, 2 potentiated influenza vaccines were specifically licensed for the elderly: Fluad®, an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM-MF59), and Intanza 15mcg®, a non adjuvanted vaccine administered intradermally (ID). The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of studies that evaluated antibody responses in the elderly following immunization with IM-MF59 or ID vaccines. The two potentiated vaccines induced immune responses satisfying, in most instances, the European Medicine Agency immunogenicity criteria, both against vaccine antigens and heterovariant drifted strains. Considering pooled data reported in the articles analyzed and papers directly comparing the 2 vaccines, the antibody responses elicited by IM-MF59 and ID were found to be generally comparable. The use of IM-MF59 and ID vaccines can be proposed as an appropriate strategy for elderly seasonal influenza vaccination although further studies are required for a more complete characterization of the 2 vaccines.\n",

    "As reported in Table 1 , 25 studies on immune response of people aged ≥60 y after immunization with seasonal IM-MF59 were included in our systematic review for a total of 3492 subjects for A/H3N2 antigen, 3396 for A/H1N1 and 3545 for B antigen. One of the studies evaluated the results over a period of 3 winter seasons. Citation Three trials examined responses against A/H3N2 strain only Citation and one against B strain only. Citation The results of 13 clinical trials, representing an integrated development program of the manufacture, for a total of 2012 subjects vaccinated with IM-MF59 and 1498 with a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine, reported in 2 meta-analyses Citation were not considered since results were reported as pooled analyses and expressed as IM-MF59 to comparator ratio. However, data from some of the 25 trials herein considered Citation are included in the 2 meta-analyses.\n",
    "For all the 25 trials, with a few exceptions, it was possible to examine numerical data or only fulfillment or not of EMA requirements for elderly people for post-vaccination seroprotection rate, GMTR (except for Baldo 2006 Citation ), and seroconversion rate (except for Del Giudice et al. 2006 Citation and Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation ). Protective HI titers higher than the generally accepted value of 40 were considered by Minutello et al. Citation and De Donato et al. Citation (HI ≥128) and Gasparini et al. (HI ≥160). Citation\n",
    "With regard to responses against A/H3N2 antigen, the requested post-vaccination value of at least 60% of people with HI protective titers was always reached (range 70.8–100%) with 2 exceptions, both considering as protective titers higher than 40, Minutello et al. Citation (third year of observation, 51%) and Gasparini et al. Citation (51%). The requested values of GMTR (≥2) and of seroconversion (≥30%) were always satisfied and ranged from 2.4 to 17.6 and from 30.0 to 92.9%, respectively.\n",
    "The examination of HI titers against A/H1N1 antigen showed that the values of seroprotection were >60% (range 71.6–100%) with the exclusion of the first year of observation for Minutello et al. Citation (22.0%, protective titers ≥128) and for Basileo et al. Citation (40.1%), the values of GMTR >2 (range 2.1–13.7) except for Minutello et al. Citation (1.8, third year of observation) and Gasparini et al. Citation (1.9). The requested value of at least 30% of seroconversion was not reached in 6 instances Citation with percentages ranging from 20.0 to 28.3%, whereas when the percentages were satisfied, they ranged from 32.0 to 94.4%.\n",
    "The responses against B antigen were somewhat lower since the 60% of seroprotected individuals in 7 of the studies (range 35.7–58.2%) Citation and the 30% of seroconversions in 6 of the trials (range 10.0–26.9%) Citation were not reached. When the requested criteria were satisfied the percentages of seroprotected individuals ranged from 63.0 to 100% and seroconversion percentages ranged from 32.8 to 89.0%. The GMTR was always >2 (range 2.1–16.2) with 3 exceptions, Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation (1.8), Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation (1.6).\n",
    "Considering all the studies examined, the results obtained showed that IM-MF59 vaccine met, as requested, in most instances 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria. The worst, but still acceptable results, were obtained by Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen and by Minutello et al. Citation the third year of observation and by Scheifele et al. Citation and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation against B antigen, when only one of the EMA criteria was satisfied.\n",
    "Table 2 reports HI antibody responses induced following administration of ID vaccine using BD's Soluvia to volunteers aged ≥60 y in the 9 different clinical studies considered in the present review. Citation Citation In the study by Arnou et al. Citation the results over 3 consecutive years were reported and in one study (Ansaldi et al. 2012 Citation ) only the results for A/H3N2 strain were included. The total number of subjects examined was 5035 for A/H3N2 and 5100 for A/H1N1 and B antigens. Some of the clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of different doses of Intanza® and compared the results with other vaccines; however, in our review only the results obtained with Intanza 15mcg® were examined.\n",
    "All the studies satisfied the 3 EMA criteria for the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, with the exception of Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen when only the GMTR value was met. For results satisfying EMA requirements, the seroprotection rate ranged from 71.0 to 98.1% and from 63.0 to 93.1%; the GMTR from 2.6 and 8.2 and from 2.0 to 8.1 and, finally, seroconversion from 33.7 to 71.8% and from 35.2 to 76.3%, respectively for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens. As found for IM-MF59, the HI antibody response induced by B strain was lower. The required 60% of seroprotected volunteers was reached in only some of the studies reporting the results for B strain with values ranging from 66.1 to 100%. Values below 60% were found in the first and second year of Arnou et al. Citation (55.7 and 59.9%, respectively) and in Van Damme et al. Citation The GMTR was in most instances >2 (range 2.5 and 3.7) except in the second year of Arnou et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Tsang et al. Citation (1.7) studies. Seroconversion rates >30% were found in 6 trials (range 36.4–46.0%). The values of the studies that did not satisfy EMA criteria Citation ranged from 15.8 to 17.2%. In all the years studied, 3 or at least 2 of the EMA immunogenicity criteria were satisfied, except the second year of the study by Arnou et al. Citation when none of the immunogenicity criteria was satisfied and the studies conducted by Van Damme et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation and Tsang et al. Citation when only one value was reached. However, Van Damme et al., Citation and Scheifele et al., Citation measured antibody titers using both HI and SRH methods. The study by Van Damme et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using SRH satisfied all 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria not only against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, confirming data observed using HI method, but also against B antigen, against which only one of the 3 criteria was satisfied using HI test. On the other hand, the study of Scheifele et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using HI method satisfied all 3 EMA criteria against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and only one against B strain. Conversely, by using SRH method the fulfilled criteria were 2 against A strains and the same one against B strain.\n",
    "A direct comparison of immunogenicity of IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, measuring antibody titers both using HI and SRH methods, was recently reported by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation who examined elderly people immunized for 2007/2008 and for 2011/2012 Winter seasons, respectively.\n",
    "Van Damme et al. Citation found that there were no differences between the 2 vaccine groups in GMTR, seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains by either HI or SRH method with the exception of seroprotection rate for the A/H1N1 strain. Seroprotection rates were high in both groups, but significantly higher in the IM-MF59 group (differences of 5.8% (0.7–10.9) and 5.8% (1.1–10.5) by HI and SRH method respectively). Moreover, considering an arbitrary definition of non-inferiority (upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals around the post-vaccination ratios of GMT IM-MF59/ID being <1.5), Van Damme et al. Citation demonstrated GMT non inferiority of ID vs. IM-MF59 vaccine for A/H1N1 and B strains with HI method and for all 3 strains with SRH method. In addition, post-hoc analysis to adjust for baseline antibody titers demonstrated ID vaccine non-inferiority using both HI and SRH methods for all 3 strains.\n",
    "Scheifele et al. Citation found that 21 d after vaccination seroprotection rates and GMT values were significantly higher after IM-MF59 vaccine vs. ID vaccine both against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains when measured by HI and SRH methods, with the exception of seroprotection rates against A/H1N1 measured by SRH method that were similar in the 2 vaccine groups. However, the differences although being statistically significant, were modest. Meaningful response assessment against B vaccine strain was not possible due to the presence of very high baseline titers. Using the same arbitrary definition of non-inferiority used by Van Damme et al, Citation Scheifele et al. Citation found that HI responses against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for ID relative to IM-MF59 vaccine, whereas the results were similar to all 3 vaccine antigens when assessed by SRH.\n",
    "Results obtained by our research group comparing the immunogenicity evaluated as HI antibody induction of IM-MF59 and ID in elderly institutionalized volunteers during the 2011–2012 Citation and the 2012–2013 Citation Winter seasons were recently published. The results observed in the 2011–2012 Winter season, the same examined by Scheifele et al., Citation showed that against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens both vaccines induced significant comparable increases in HI titers and the responses satisfied all 3 EMA requirements. Against B strain both vaccines stimulated responses lower as compared with the A antigens, moreover the responses were generally higher after ID than IM-MF59 and all 3 EMA criteria were met after ID and only one (seroprotection rate) after IM-MF59. Considering the results of the 2012–2013 winter season Citation both vaccines induced comparable significant HI antibody responses against the 3 vaccine strains. All three EMA criteria were satisfied against A/H3N2 and B antigens, whereas responses against A/H1N1 antigen were somewhat lower since only one criteria was met with both vaccines. Responses against B antigen tended to be higher in subjects vaccinated with ID than those immunized with IM-MF59 vaccine again, as observed in the Winter 2011–2012. Citation\n",
    "Finally, in order to try to have more information about possible differences between IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, immunogenicity data reported for the 2 vaccines in the different studies analyzed in this review were compared. Because of the different years in which IM-MF59 and ID vaccines were commercialized, 1997 and 2010 respectively, the years examined, the vaccine composition and the number of people studied, differ between the 2 vaccines. In order to analyze if differences between the pooled data from the studies analyzed for the 2 vaccines were significant statistically, an hypothesis test was applied. In particular, because of the differences in the data available and because the standard deviation values of the immunogenicity values were prevalently missing, a 2-samples pooled t-test at the α = 5% significance level was selected as the most appropriate hypothesis test. The mean and confidence interval values estimated for the 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria (seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion) are reported in Figure 1 . Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

The horizontal dashed line indicates the EMA threshold level for each parameter.\n",
    "In addition to the suboptimal immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in elderly people, another important limitation of influenza vaccination, during the inter-pandemic periods, is a direct consequence of the antigenic drift due to the accumulation of point mutations on genes encoding the 2 surface proteins, HA and neuraminidase, resulting in changes in the antigenic characteristics of the circulating strains, possibly determining significant mismatches between the latter and the viral variants included in the vaccine, with consequent inadequate protection of vaccines. Citation The availability of influenza vaccines offering a higher and broader immune response than that conferred by conventional formulations could represent a fundamental challenge in the prevention of influenza.\n",
    "Table 3 reports data demonstrating that IM-MF59-adjuvanted and ID vaccines have been found reproducibly to confer cross-reactivity against drifted virus strains in the elderly patients aged ≥60. Citation Citation HI antibody responses against A/H3N2 co-circulating during the winter period studied Citation and A/H3N2 strains recommended as vaccine component for previous or forthcoming winter seasons Citation were found to fulfill in most instances all the 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria both after IM-MF59 Citation or ID Citation vaccine administration. Similar results were obtained studying antibody responses induced by IM-MF59 Citation or ID Citation vaccines against A/H1N1 chosen as vaccine strain for forthcoming winter season Citation or A/H1N1 circulating among the population. Citation Induction of cross-reactive HI antibodies against influenza B virus strain was examined only after IM-MF59 vaccination in 3 different studies. Citation Influenza B viruses fall in 2 major antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, co-circulating in some years among the population and currently in many countries only one type B strain, representing one of the 2 lineages, can be incorporated into the vaccine. Citation Increases in HI antibody titers were found against drifted B strains, both belonging to the same or different lineage as compared to vaccine strain. However, the responses prevalently satisfy, both against the vaccine and the drifted strains, only one of the 3 EMA criteria. Table 3.

    "===== Characteristics of the Two\tEnhanced Vaccines: Fluad® and Intanza 15mcg® =====\n",
    "Fluad® (Novartis Vaccines, Italy) is an MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine, licensed in Italy in 1997, and administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle (IM-MF59). It is an inactivated subunit vaccine containing the standard dosage of 15 μg in each 0.5 ml dose of highly-purified influenza surface haemagglutinin (HA) antigen per strain and an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene, a naturally occurring biodegradable and biocompatible substance, found in the liver in a wide range of species, including humans. Citation The aim of the MF59 adjuvant is to increase the vaccine immunogenicity. Citation The mechanism of action of MF59 is not fully understood. Initially it was thought that the enhance of protection might be due to a depot effect: delivering the antigen in an oil-in-water emulsion would result into a slow release of the antigen and a more effective priming of the immune system. Indeed MF59 emulsion was found to induce a local immune-stimulatory environment, which is able to optimize the activation of the innate immune response at the injection site, by recruiting and activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs). APCs acquire an increased ability to capture, transport and process co-administered antigens from the peripheral tissues to local lymph nodes and consequently, stimulate an effective adaptive memory immune response specific to the vaccine. Citation\n",
    "Intanza 15mcg® (Sanofi Pasteur MSD SNC, France) is a split trivalent non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID) which uses an innovative microinjection system (Soluvia, Becton Dickinson, USA) and has been available in Italy since the Winter season 2010–2011. The manufacturing processing is based on that used for the intramuscular seasonal vaccine although a lower volume is used for intradermal vaccine (15 μg HA/strain per 0.1 ml instead of 0.5 ml). Intradermal vaccination is a more efficient route for influenza vaccines Citation and is supposed to increase vaccine immunogenicity by reliably delivering the vaccine into the immune-rich environment of the dermis where the presence of a high density of lymphatic and capillary vessels facilitates a direct contact between administered antigens and immune system. Citation The exact mechanisms involved in intradermal immunization are not fully understood, however, it is known that skin generates both innate and adaptive immune system responses. Two types of professional APCs (Langherans cells in the epidermis and dermal dendritic cells (DCs) in the dermis) play a pivotal role in skin's innate immune response and induction of adaptive immune response against pathogens. Citation These DCs favor rapid capture and movement of antigen via lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes, thus facilitating lymph node T and B cells activation/expansion and induction of antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity. Citation Antigens can also drain into the lymph nodes with no involvement of peripheral tissue DCs and be captured by lymph node resident DCs from skin migratory DCs, with subsequent priming of naïve T cells. Citation\n",
    "Clearly, the immune response induced by intradermal antigen delivery is generated by a mechanism which markedly differs from that of the intramuscular route. Citation\n",
    "The deep muscle is relatively inefficient in capturing antigens by immune cells, and only circulating DCs are able to capture antigens and migrate to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatic conduits or bloodstream. Vaccine antigens delivered to the skin are more likely to be captured by resident APCs, such as Langherans cells and dermal DCs, and transported to the draining lymph nodes for B cells to respond.\n",
    "IM-MF59 and ID influenza vaccines were repetitively examined for safety and tolerability in clinical trials. Although a number of results were available, 2 meta-analysis on IM-MF59 Citation and 2 randomized controlled trials on ID Citation including safety data in adults >60 y of age with and without underlying diseases were identified. These studies included trials comparing IM-MF59 or ID with non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines; however we considered results concerning the 2 potentiated vaccines only. The analysis of solicited local and systemic reactions that occurred 0/3–7 d after vaccination revealed a constant rate in subjects receiving IM-MF59 or ID, generally higher as compared with volunteers receiving a conventional influenza vaccine. However, the majority of solicited reactions were local, and mild or moderate in intensity both after IM-MF59 Citation and ID. Citation Recently, 2 different studies carried out by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation directly compared, in addition to immunogenicity, safety and tolerability, of IM-MF59 and ID in the elderly. Adverse events in the first 3 d post-vaccination were similar for the 2 vaccines and symptoms were mild to moderate. Injection–site reactions assessed in the first 6–7 d post-vaccination confirmed previous data and appeared to be more common in the ID group as compared with IM-MF59 group. Erythema or local inflammation were the most frequent symptoms among ID recipients and were reported in 63.1% by Van Damme et al. Citation and in 76.2% by Scheifele et al.

    "===== Serological Criteria for Influenza Vaccine Evaluation =====\n",
    "For influenza vaccines there are protection correlates that although being imperfect are based on immunological criteria shared by the international scientific community and regulatory agencies that recognize that serological immune criteria may support the approval of influenza vaccines. Citation\n",
    "The ability to elicit HA strain-specific antibodies in the serum of immunized persons is the major indicator of influenza vaccine immunogenicity used for vaccine studies and licensure and a marker of protective efficacy. To date 2 different assays qualified for detection of anti-HA influenza strain-specific antibodies are used for vaccine licensure: the haemagglutination inhibiting assay (HI) and the single radial hemolysis test (SRH). Citation The HI assay is the most widely used because of its relatively simplicity. The HI test takes advantage of the influenza virus ability to agglutinate red blood cells via HA binding to sialic residues on red blood cells. Antibodies directed to HA antigen can inhibit this haemagglutination, and HI titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that inhibits haemagglutination. Different studies suggest that HI titers ≥40 can be considered as a 50% protective titer. Citation However there is the need to better define correlates of protection and there are some perplexities on the identification of a single threshold HI titer for defining protection. Citation The SRH is a different test that can be used to detect antibodies to HA, but is less frequently reported. Citation The test is based on immunodiffusion of antibodies against HA in agarose gel containing influenza virus bound to red blood cells and complement. The presence of anti-HA antibodies is detected by the lysis of red blood cells and antibody titers are measured in square millimeters (mm ) of the zone of lysis.\n",
    "Parameters including seroprotection rate (proportion of individuals achieving an HI titer of ≥40 or an SRH lysis area ≥25 mm Citation ), ratio of post-vaccination to pre-vaccination geometric mean titer values (GMTR) and seroconversion rate (proportion of individuals that have a fourfold or grater rise in HI titer or an SRH area increase >50% from pre- to post-vaccination titer, and seronegative individuals that achieve a titer of ≥40 or an SRH area ≥25 mm ) are conventionally used to estimate the advantages provided by vaccines and to support licensure of inactivated vaccines. Up to the present time, in Europe, for annual licensure to be granted for a specific influenza vaccine in the pre-defined age groups, EMA requires that post-vaccination titers against influenza HA antigens meet specific criteria. Citation For individuals ≥60 y at least one of the following values must be met for each vaccine strain: seroprotection rate ≥60%, GMTR ≥2 and seroconversion rate ≥30%. Citation\n",
    "Finally, it is important to underline that a third test, the neutralization (NT) assay, would represent a useful adjunct for detection and evaluation of antibody responses induced by influenza vaccine administration. Citation NT assay detects antibodies that inhibit virus replication and is considered to provide a more functional assessment of vaccine-induced immunity. Moreover, since in many instances it has been found to be more sensitive than HI test in detecting higher antibody titers, it might be preferable to confirm the immunogenicity data by using NT assay, Citation although to the present time NT test is not included in the assays used for vaccine licensure, since there is no known protection titer for NT antibodies.\n",

    "Twenty five studies were included in this review.

The population consisted of elderly subjects with and without underlying diseases, Citation Citation Citation with unknown health status Citation or healthy. Citation Citation No sub-analyses were conducted to evaluate potential differences in the outcome between these groups.\n",
    "The studies were prevalently conducted with the aim of comparing the 2 enhanced vaccines with conventional vaccines. However, in this review we considered only immunogenicity data of the 2 potentiated vaccines. Although in the absence of a standardization of the existing assays, the homologous and heterologous HI antibody responses induced by IM-MF59 and ID in people aged ≥60 y were explored as reported in the studies reviewed, considering if EMA immunogenicity criteria were satisfied. Citation Since results from some of the studies were reported as figures instead of numerical data, only the fulfillment, if any, of EMA requirements was considered.

One of the studies evaluated the results over a period of 3 winter seasons. Citation Three trials examined responses against A/H3N2 strain only Citation and one against B strain only. Citation The results of 13 clinical trials, representing an integrated development program of the manufacture, for a total of 2012 subjects vaccinated with IM-MF59 and 1498 with a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine, reported in 2 meta-analyses Citation were not considered since results were reported as pooled analyses and expressed as IM-MF59 to comparator ratio. However, data from some of the 25 trials herein considered Citation are included in the 2 meta-analyses. For all the 25 trials, with a few exceptions, it was possible to examine numerical data or only fulfillment or not of EMA requirements for elderly people for post-vaccination seroprotection rate, GMTR (except for Baldo 2006 Citation ), and seroconversion rate (except for Del Giudice et al. 2006 Citation and Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation ). Protective HI titers higher than the generally accepted value of 40 were considered by Minutello et al. Citation and De Donato et al. Citation (HI ≥128) and Gasparini et al. (HI ≥160). Citation With regard to responses against A/H3N2 antigen, the requested post-vaccination value of at least 60% of people with HI protective titers was always reached (range 70.8–100%) with 2 exceptions, both considering as protective titers higher than 40, Minutello et al. Citation (third year of observation, 51%) and Gasparini et al. Citation (51%). The requested values of GMTR (≥2) and of seroconversion (≥30%) were always satisfied and ranged from 2.4 to 17.6 and from 30.0 to 92.9%, respectively. The examination of HI titers against A/H1N1 antigen showed that the values of seroprotection were >60% (range 71.6–100%) with the exclusion of the first year of observation for Minutello et al. Citation (22.0%, protective titers ≥128) and for Basileo et al. Citation (40.1%), the values of GMTR >2 (range 2.1–13.7) except for Minutello et al. Citation (1.8, third year of observation) and Gasparini et al. Citation (1.9). The requested value of at least 30% of seroconversion was not reached in 6 instances Citation with percentages ranging from 20.0 to 28.3%, whereas when the percentages were satisfied, they ranged from 32.0 to 94.4%. The responses against B antigen were somewhat lower since the 60% of seroprotected individuals in 7 of the studies (range 35.7–58.2%) Citation and the 30% of seroconversions in 6 of the trials (range 10.0–26.9%) Citation were not reached. When the requested criteria were satisfied the percentages of seroprotected individuals ranged from 63.0 to 100% and seroconversion percentages ranged from 32.8 to 89.0%.

Considering all the studies examined, the results obtained showed that IM-MF59 vaccine met, as requested, in most instances 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria. The worst, but still acceptable results, were obtained by Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen and by Minutello et al. Citation the third year of observation and by Scheifele et al. Citation and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation against B antigen, when only one of the EMA criteria was satisfied. Table 2 reports HI antibody responses induced following administration of ID vaccine using BD's Soluvia to volunteers aged ≥60 y in the 9 different clinical studies considered in the present review. Citation Citation In the study by Arnou et al. Citation the results over 3 consecutive years were reported and in one study (Ansaldi et al. 2012 Citation ) only the results for A/H3N2 strain were included. The total number of subjects examined was 5035 for A/H3N2 and 5100 for A/H1N1 and B antigens. Some of the clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of different doses of Intanza® and compared the results with other vaccines; however, in our review only the results obtained with Intanza 15mcg® were examined. All the studies satisfied the 3 EMA criteria for the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, with the exception of Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen when only the GMTR value was met. For results satisfying EMA requirements, the seroprotection rate ranged from 71.0 to 98.1% and from 63.0 to 93.1%; the GMTR from 2.6 and 8.2 and from 2.0 to 8.1 and, finally, seroconversion from 33.7 to 71.8% and from 35.2 to 76.3%, respectively for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens. As found for IM-MF59, the HI antibody response induced by B strain was lower. The required 60% of seroprotected volunteers was reached in only some of the studies reporting the results for B strain with values ranging from 66.1 to 100%. Values below 60% were found in the first and second year of Arnou et al. Citation (55.7 and 59.9%, respectively) and in Van Damme et al. Citation The GMTR was in most instances >2 (range 2.5 and 3.7) except in the second year of Arnou et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Tsang et al. Citation (1.7) studies. Seroconversion rates >30% were found in 6 trials (range 36.4–46.0%). The values of the studies that did not satisfy EMA criteria Citation ranged from 15.8 to 17.2%. In all the years studied, 3 or at least 2 of the EMA immunogenicity criteria were satisfied, except the second year of the study by Arnou et al. Citation when none of the immunogenicity criteria was satisfied and the studies conducted by Van Damme et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation and Tsang et al. Citation when only one value was reached. However, Van Damme et al., Citation and Scheifele et al., Citation measured antibody titers using both HI and SRH methods. The study by Van Damme et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using SRH satisfied all 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria not only against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, confirming data observed using HI method, but also against B antigen, against which only one of the 3 criteria was satisfied using HI test. On the other hand, the study of Scheifele et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using HI method satisfied all 3 EMA criteria against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and only one against B strain. Conversely, by using SRH method the fulfilled criteria were 2 against A strains and the same one against B strain. A direct comparison of immunogenicity of IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, measuring antibody titers both using HI and SRH methods, was recently reported by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation who examined elderly people immunized for 2007/2008 and for 2011/2012 Winter seasons, respectively. Van Damme et al. Citation found that there were no differences between the 2 vaccine groups in GMTR, seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains by either HI or SRH method with the exception of seroprotection rate for the A/H1N1 strain. Seroprotection rates were high in both groups, but significantly higher in the IM-MF59 group (differences of 5.8% (0.7–10.9) and 5.8% (1.1–10.5) by HI and SRH method respectively). Moreover, considering an arbitrary definition of non-inferiority (upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals around the post-vaccination ratios of GMT IM-MF59/ID being <1.5), Van Damme et al. Citation demonstrated GMT non inferiority of ID vs. IM-MF59 vaccine for A/H1N1 and B strains with HI method and for all 3 strains with SRH method. In addition, post-hoc analysis to adjust for baseline antibody titers demonstrated ID vaccine non-inferiority using both HI and SRH methods for all 3 strains. Scheifele et al. Citation found that 21 d after vaccination seroprotection rates and GMT values were significantly higher after IM-MF59 vaccine vs. ID vaccine both against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains when measured by HI and SRH methods, with the exception of seroprotection rates against A/H1N1 measured by SRH method that were similar in the 2 vaccine groups. However, the differences although being statistically significant, were modest. Meaningful response assessment against B vaccine strain was not possible due to the presence of very high baseline titers. Using the same arbitrary definition of non-inferiority used by Van Damme et al, Citation Scheifele et al. Citation found that HI responses against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for ID relative to IM-MF59 vaccine, whereas the results were similar to all 3 vaccine antigens when assessed by SRH. Results obtained by our research group comparing the immunogenicity evaluated as HI antibody induction of IM-MF59 and ID in elderly institutionalized volunteers during the 2011–2012 Citation and the 2012–2013 Citation Winter seasons were recently published. The results observed in the 2011–2012 Winter season, the same examined by Scheifele et al., Citation showed that against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens both vaccines induced significant comparable increases in HI titers and the responses satisfied all 3 EMA requirements. Against B strain both vaccines stimulated responses lower as compared with the A antigens, moreover the responses were generally higher after ID than IM-MF59 and all 3 EMA criteria were met after ID and only one (seroprotection rate) after IM-MF59. Considering the results of the 2012–2013 winter season Citation both vaccines induced comparable significant HI antibody responses against the 3 vaccine strains. All three EMA criteria were satisfied against A/H3N2 and B antigens, whereas responses against A/H1N1 antigen were somewhat lower since only one criteria was met with both vaccines. Responses against B antigen tended to be higher in subjects vaccinated with ID than those immunized with IM-MF59 vaccine again, as observed in the Winter 2011–2012. Citation Finally, in order to try to have more information about possible differences between IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, immunogenicity data reported for the 2 vaccines in the different studies analyzed in this review were compared. Because of the different years in which IM-MF59 and ID vaccines were commercialized, 1997 and 2010 respectively, the years examined, the vaccine composition and the number of people studied, differ between the 2 vaccines. In order to analyze if differences between the pooled data from the studies analyzed for the 2 vaccines were significant statistically, an hypothesis test was applied. In particular, because of the differences in the data available and because the standard deviation values of the immunogenicity values were prevalently missing, a 2-samples pooled t-test at the α = 5% significance level was selected as the most appropriate hypothesis test. The mean and confidence interval values estimated for the 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria (seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion) are reported in Figure 1 . Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

    "Immunogenicity of FLUAD and INTANZA 15mcg® in elderly people: heterologous responses In addition to the suboptimal immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in elderly people, another important limitation of influenza vaccination, during the inter-pandemic periods, is a direct consequence of the antigenic drift due to the accumulation of point mutations on genes encoding the 2 surface proteins, HA and neuraminidase, resulting in changes in the antigenic characteristics of the circulating strains, possibly determining significant mismatches between the latter and the viral variants included in the vaccine, with consequent inadequate protection of vaccines. Citation The availability of influenza vaccines offering a higher and broader immune response than that conferred by conventional formulations could represent a fundamental challenge in the prevention of influenza. Table 3 reports data demonstrating that IM-MF59-adjuvanted and ID vaccines have been found reproducibly to confer cross-reactivity against drifted virus strains in the elderly patients aged ≥60. Citation Citation HI antibody responses against A/H3N2 co-circulating during the winter period studied Citation and A/H3N2 strains recommended as vaccine component for previous or forthcoming winter seasons Citation were found to fulfill in most instances all the 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria both after IM-MF59 Citation or ID Citation vaccine administration. Similar results were obtained studying antibody responses induced by IM-MF59 Citation or ID Citation vaccines against A/H1N1 chosen as vaccine strain for forthcoming winter season Citation or A/H1N1 circulating among the population. Citation Induction of cross-reactive HI antibodies against influenza B virus strain was examined only after IM-MF59 vaccination in 3 different studies. Citation Influenza B viruses fall in 2 major antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, co-circulating in some years among the population and currently in many countries only one type B strain, representing one of the 2 lineages, can be incorporated into the vaccine. Citation Increases in HI antibody titers were found against drifted B strains, both belonging to the same or different lineage as compared to vaccine strain. However, the responses prevalently satisfy, both against the vaccine and the drifted strains, only one of the 3 EMA criteria. Table 3.

However, the differences although being statistically significant, were modest. Meaningful response assessment against B vaccine strain was not possible due to the presence of very high baseline titers. Using the same arbitrary definition of non-inferiority used by Van Damme et al, Citation Scheifele et al. Citation found that HI responses against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for ID relative to IM-MF59 vaccine, whereas the results were similar to all 3 vaccine antigens when assessed by SRH.\n",
    "Results obtained by our research group comparing the immunogenicity evaluated as HI antibody induction of IM-MF59 and ID in elderly institutionalized volunteers during the 2011–2012 Citation and the 2012–2013 Citation Winter seasons were recently published. The results observed in the 2011–2012 Winter season, the same examined by Scheifele et al., Citation showed that against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens both vaccines induced significant comparable increases in HI titers and the responses satisfied all 3 EMA requirements. Against B strain both vaccines stimulated responses lower as compared with the A antigens, moreover the responses were generally higher after ID than IM-MF59 and all 3 EMA criteria were met after ID and only one (seroprotection rate) after IM-MF59. Considering the results of the 2012–2013 winter season Citation both vaccines induced comparable significant HI antibody responses against the 3 vaccine strains. All three EMA criteria were satisfied against A/H3N2 and B antigens, whereas responses against A/H1N1 antigen were somewhat lower since only one criteria was met with both vaccines. Responses against B antigen tended to be higher in subjects vaccinated with ID than those immunized with IM-MF59 vaccine again, as observed in the Winter 2011–2012. Citation\n",
    "Finally, in order to try to have more information about possible differences between IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, immunogenicity data reported for the 2 vaccines in the different studies analyzed in this review were compared. Because of the different years in which IM-MF59 and ID vaccines were commercialized, 1997 and 2010 respectively, the years examined, the vaccine composition and the number of people studied, differ between the 2 vaccines. In order to analyze if differences between the pooled data from the studies analyzed for the 2 vaccines were significant statistically, an hypothesis test was applied. In particular, because of the differences in the data available and because the standard deviation values of the immunogenicity values were prevalently missing, a 2-samples pooled t-test at the α = 5% significance level was selected as the most appropriate hypothesis test. The mean and confidence interval values estimated for the 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria (seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion) are reported in Figure 1 . Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

    "In addition to the suboptimal immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in elderly people, another important limitation of influenza vaccination, during the inter-pandemic periods, is a direct consequence of the antigenic drift due to the accumulation of point mutations on genes encoding the 2 surface proteins, HA and neuraminidase, resulting in changes in the antigenic characteristics of the circulating strains, possibly determining significant mismatches between the latter and the viral variants included in the vaccine, with consequent inadequate protection of vaccines.

    "===== Conclusions =====\n",
    "Previous published studies have established that the immune response induced by IM-MF59 and ID potentiated vaccines, specially licensed for elderly people and marketed in Italy in 1997 and 2010 respectively, can be considered higher in elderly people as compared to conventional vaccines Citation Citation Citation ; however, it is unclear if one of the 2 potentiated vaccines offers any advantages.\n",
    "In order to have more information, in this review, we examined data previously obtained and published in terms of immunogenicity, evaluated in most instances as induction of HI titers according to the 3 EMA immunogenicity requirements (i.e., seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion), studying people aged ≥60 y immunized with the 2 potentiated vaccines.\n",
    "We found evidence of a good and prevalently comparable immunogenicity profile of IM-MF59 and ID potentiated vaccines in elderly subjects both against homologous and heterologous influenza virus strains.\n",
    "The homologous responses against the 3 vaccine antigens were firstly examined considering the responses reported in the different studies examined only after IM-MF59 ( Table 1 ) or ID ( Table 2 ) vaccine administration, although other vaccine preparations were studied. We found that the EMA requirements in most instances were satisfied for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 vaccine antigens with both vaccines. The responses against the B antigen were somewhat lower, since frequently only one or 2 of the 3 EMA requirements were satisfied. The reduced responses against B influenza virus strains are in accordance with previous reports suggesting that the antibody response to inactivated conventional or potentiated vaccines is substantially lower against type B antigen than against type A antigens Citation and seem to suggest that possible strategies to control influenza B viruses should be considered separately from those of influenza A viruses. However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by the observation that the HI test is considered not to be well adapted to measure the response against B influenza viruses. Ether treatment of the viral antigen used for HI testing was found to enhance sensitivity for influenza B responses Citation but the higher HI titers observed with B strain virus treated with ether seem to be less specific and not comparable with titers obtained against A antigens not treated with ether. In the absence of international protocols or validated correlation with clinical protection, the use of ether is not considered a valid solution to the problem.\n",
    "Secondly, since the results examined were obtained in different studies, in order to compare this data, we examined the pooled results by applying the 2-sample t-test that takes into account both the different sample size of the 2 vaccines and the a-priori non-knowledge of their confidence intervals. The values of HI antibody titers against the 3 homologous vaccine antigens did not significantly differ across the 2 potentiated vaccines ( Fig. 1 ) for the 3 EMA requirements, except for the seroconversion values against A/H3N2 antigen showing a higher value after IM-MF59 administration as compared to ID vaccine.\n",
    "Thirdly, the analysis of the results of the few comparative head-to-head immunogenicity studies published in the literature to date showed that the results reported were slightly varying. An higher induction of HI antibody titers by IM-MF59 compared to ID was found by Van Damme et al. Citation against the A/H3N2 strain, but no differences were found after adjusting titers for baseline antibody, and by Scheifele et al. Citation against the 2 A strains. However, responses in the 2 studies were similar when assessed by SRH method. Citation The results of our research group Citation showed a similar immunogenicity against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and a slightly higher immunogenicity against B strain following ID administration as compared to IM-MF59 vaccine.\n",
    "Finally, some of the trials examined Citation studied the induction of heterologous HI antibody responses, i.e., responses against influenza strains not included in the vaccine used for immunization, following immunization with IM-MF59 and ID vaccines and found results generally satisfying all or at least some of the EMA requirements ( Table 3 ).\n",
    "In conclusion, data reported in this review suggest that IM-MF59 and ID vaccines might be appropriate strategies to address the challenge of declining immune responses in older people, even during seasons when antigenic drifts occur. Because of previous good safety results, despite the higher incidence of some injection-site reactions in ID vaccinated compared with IM-MF59 vaccine, Citation data reported in this review suggest that IM-MF59 and ID vaccines can provide clinicians with an opportunity to better control influenza in aged people, although, further studies and trials are desirable because of different problems.\n",
    "A significant heterogeneity was found across the studies examined for the immunogenicity outcomes. Differences between studies in terms of age, sex, health conditions and previous influenza vaccinations of the elderly volunteers immunized or the antigen vaccine composition of the vaccines used in the studies considered might have influenced the results.\n",
    "Inter-laboratory variability in serological techniques and determination was previously shown suggesting the need for improved standardization of assays and study design. Citation Immunogenicity was evaluated as the ability of vaccines to induce HI antibody responses and inter-laboratory variability for the HI assay has been previously found to be higher as compared with SRH and NT test. Citation HI titers were considered according to EMA immunogenicity criteria Citation although there are some disagreements on the identification of a single threshold (HI titer ≥40) for defining protection. Citation The HI assay has some limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity Citation and recent studies show that serum HI antibody titers may not be associated with the development of influenza. Moreover, because of the importance and difficulties of evaluating efficacy and effectiveness of vaccine administration, there is the need for studies to provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness during each season and to collect protection data from laboratory-confirmed cases (PCR or virus isolation). Additionally, the antibody response is not necessarily the best predictor of clinical efficacy in older adults Citation and because of this possible lack of correlation, further studies are necessary to evaluate cell-mediated immunity and the association of antibody and cellular responses with clinical outcomes, including the occurrence of influenza illness, hospitalizations, and mortality.\n",

    "As reported in Table 1 , 25 studies on immune response of people aged ≥60 y after immunization with seasonal IM-MF59 were included in our systematic review for a total of 3492 subjects for A/H3N2 antigen, 3396 for A/H1N1 and 3545 for B antigen. One of the studies evaluated the results over a period of 3 winter seasons. Citation Three trials examined responses against A/H3N2 strain only Citation and one against B strain only. Citation The results of 13 clinical trials, representing an integrated development program of the manufacture, for a total of 2012 subjects vaccinated with IM-MF59 and 1498 with a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine, reported in 2 meta-analyses Citation were not considered since results were reported as pooled analyses and expressed as IM-MF59 to comparator ratio. However, data from some of the 25 trials herein considered Citation are included in the 2 meta-analyses.\n",
    "For all the 25 trials, with a few exceptions, it was possible to examine numerical data or only fulfillment or not of EMA requirements for elderly people for post-vaccination seroprotection rate, GMTR (except for Baldo 2006 Citation ), and seroconversion rate (except for Del Giudice et al. 2006 Citation and Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation ). Protective HI titers higher than the generally accepted value of 40 were considered by Minutello et al. Citation and De Donato et al. Citation (HI ≥128) and Gasparini et al. (HI ≥160). Citation\n",
    "With regard to responses against A/H3N2 antigen, the requested post-vaccination value of at least 60% of people with HI protective titers was always reached (range 70.8–100%) with 2 exceptions, both considering as protective titers higher than 40, Minutello et al.

    "Considering all the studies examined, the results obtained showed that IM-MF59 vaccine met, as requested, in most instances 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria. The worst, but still acceptable results, were obtained by Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen and by Minutello et al. Citation the third year of observation and by Scheifele et al.

The total number of subjects examined was 5035 for A/H3N2 and 5100 for A/H1N1 and B antigens. Some of the clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of different doses of Intanza® and compared the results with other vaccines; however, in our review only the results obtained with Intanza 15mcg® were examined.\n",
    "All the studies satisfied the 3 EMA criteria for the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, with the exception of Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen when only the GMTR value was met. For results satisfying EMA requirements, the seroprotection rate ranged from 71.0 to 98.1% and from 63.0 to 93.1%; the GMTR from 2.6 and 8.2 and from 2.0 to 8.1 and, finally, seroconversion from 33.7 to 71.8% and from 35.2 to 76.3%, respectively for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens. As found for IM-MF59, the HI antibody response induced by B strain was lower. The required 60% of seroprotected volunteers was reached in only some of the studies reporting the results for B strain with values ranging from 66.1 to 100%. Values below 60% were found in the first and second year of Arnou et al. Citation (55.7 and 59.9%, respectively) and in Van Damme et al. Citation The GMTR was in most instances >2 (range 2.5 and 3.7) except in the second year of Arnou et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Tsang et al. Citation (1.7) studies. Seroconversion rates >30% were found in 6 trials (range 36.4–46.0%). The values of the studies that did not satisfy EMA criteria Citation ranged from 15.8 to 17.2%.

Citation when none of the immunogenicity criteria was satisfied and the studies conducted by Van Damme et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation and Tsang et al. Citation when only one value was reached. However, Van Damme et al., Citation and Scheifele et al., Citation measured antibody titers using both HI and SRH methods.

On the other hand, the study of Scheifele et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using HI method satisfied all 3 EMA criteria against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and only one against B strain. Conversely, by using SRH method the fulfilled criteria were 2 against A strains and the same one against B strain.\n",
    "A direct comparison of immunogenicity of IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, measuring antibody titers both using HI and SRH methods, was recently reported by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation who examined elderly people immunized for 2007/2008 and for 2011/2012 Winter seasons, respectively.\n",
    "Van Damme et al. Citation found that there were no differences between the 2 vaccine groups in GMTR, seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains by either HI or SRH method with the exception of seroprotection rate for the A/H1N1 strain. Seroprotection rates were high in both groups, but significantly higher in the IM-MF59 group (differences of 5.8% (0.7–10.9) and 5.8% (1.1–10.5) by HI and SRH method respectively). Moreover, considering an arbitrary definition of non-inferiority (upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals around the post-vaccination ratios of GMT IM-MF59/ID being <1.5), Van Damme et al. Citation demonstrated GMT non inferiority of ID vs. IM-MF59 vaccine for A/H1N1 and B strains with HI method and for all 3 strains with SRH method. In addition, post-hoc analysis to adjust for baseline antibody titers demonstrated ID vaccine non-inferiority using both HI and SRH methods for all 3 strains.\n",
    "Scheifele et al. Citation found that 21 d after vaccination seroprotection rates and GMT values were significantly higher after IM-MF59 vaccine vs. ID vaccine both against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains when measured by HI and SRH methods, with the exception of seroprotection rates against A/H1N1 measured by SRH method that were similar in the 2 vaccine groups. However, the differences although being statistically significant, were modest. Meaningful response assessment against B vaccine strain was not possible due to the presence of very high baseline titers. Using the same arbitrary definition of non-inferiority used by Van Damme et al, Citation Scheifele et al. Citation found that HI responses against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for ID relative to IM-MF59 vaccine, whereas the results were similar to all 3 vaccine antigens when assessed by SRH.\n",
    "Results obtained by our research group comparing the immunogenicity evaluated as HI antibody induction of IM-MF59 and ID in elderly institutionalized volunteers during the 2011–2012 Citation and the 2012–2013 Citation Winter seasons were recently published.

    "Finally, in order to try to have more information about possible differences between IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, immunogenicity data reported for the 2 vaccines in the different studies analyzed in this review were compared.

Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

The values of HI antibody titers against the 3 homologous vaccine antigens did not significantly differ across the 2 potentiated vaccines ( Fig. 1 ) for the 3 EMA requirements, except for the seroconversion values against A/H3N2 antigen showing a higher value after IM-MF59 administration as compared to ID vaccine.\n",
    "Thirdly, the analysis of the results of the few comparative head-to-head immunogenicity studies published in the literature to date showed that the results reported were slightly varying. An higher induction of HI antibody titers by IM-MF59 compared to ID was found by Van Damme et al. Citation against the A/H3N2 strain, but no differences were found after adjusting titers for baseline antibody, and by Scheifele et al. Citation against the 2 A strains. However, responses in the 2 studies were similar when assessed by SRH method. Citation The results of our research group Citation showed a similar immunogenicity against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and a slightly higher immunogenicity against B strain following ID administration as compared to IM-MF59 vaccine.\n",
    "Finally, some of the trials examined Citation studied the induction of heterologous HI antibody responses, i.e., responses against influenza strains not included in the vaccine used for immunization, following immunization with IM-MF59 and ID vaccines and found results generally satisfying all or at least some of the EMA requirements ( Table 3 ).\n",
    "In conclusion, data reported in this review suggest that IM-MF59 and ID vaccines might be appropriate strategies to address the challenge of declining immune responses in older people, even during seasons when antigenic drifts occur. Because of previous good safety results, despite the higher incidence of some injection-site reactions in ID vaccinated compared with IM-MF59 vaccine, Citation data reported in this review suggest that IM-MF59 and ID vaccines can provide clinicians with an opportunity to better control influenza in aged people, although, further studies and trials are desirable because of different problems.\n",
    "A significant heterogeneity was found across the studies examined for the immunogenicity outcomes. Differences between studies in terms of age, sex, health conditions and previous influenza vaccinations of the elderly volunteers immunized or the antigen vaccine composition of the vaccines used in the studies considered might have influenced the results.\n",
    "Inter-laboratory variability in serological techniques and determination was previously shown suggesting the need for improved standardization of assays and study design. Citation Immunogenicity was evaluated as the ability of vaccines to induce HI antibody responses and inter-laboratory variability for the HI assay has been previously found to be higher as compared with SRH and NT test. Citation HI titers were considered according to EMA immunogenicity criteria Citation although there are some disagreements on the identification of a single threshold (HI titer ≥40) for defining protection. Citation The HI assay has some limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity Citation and recent studies show that serum HI antibody titers may not be associated with the development of influenza. Moreover, because of the importance and difficulties of evaluating efficacy and effectiveness of vaccine administration, there is the need for studies to provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness during each season and to collect protection data from laboratory-confirmed cases (PCR or virus isolation). Additionally, the antibody response is not necessarily the best predictor of clinical efficacy in older adults Citation and because of this possible lack of correlation, further studies are necessary to evaluate cell-mediated immunity and the association of antibody and cellular responses with clinical outcomes, including the occurrence of influenza illness, hospitalizations, and mortality.\n",

    "Because of the age-related immune system decline, 2 potentiated influenza vaccines were specifically licensed for the elderly: Fluad®, an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM-MF59), and Intanza 15mcg®, a non adjuvanted vaccine administered intradermally (ID). The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of studies that evaluated antibody responses in the elderly following immunization with IM-MF59 or ID vaccines. The two potentiated vaccines induced immune responses satisfying, in most instances, the European Medicine Agency immunogenicity criteria, both against vaccine antigens and heterovariant drifted strains. Considering pooled data reported in the articles analyzed and papers directly comparing the 2 vaccines, the antibody responses elicited by IM-MF59 and ID were found to be generally comparable. The use of IM-MF59 and ID vaccines can be proposed as an appropriate strategy for elderly seasonal influenza vaccination although further studies are required for a more complete characterization of the 2 vaccines.\n",

    "As reported in Table 1 , 25 studies on immune response of people aged ≥60 y after immunization with seasonal IM-MF59 were included in our systematic review for a total of 3492 subjects for A/H3N2 antigen, 3396 for A/H1N1 and 3545 for B antigen. One of the studies evaluated the results over a period of 3 winter seasons. Citation Three trials examined responses against A/H3N2 strain only Citation and one against B strain only. Citation The results of 13 clinical trials, representing an integrated development program of the manufacture, for a total of 2012 subjects vaccinated with IM-MF59 and 1498 with a comparator non-adjuvanted vaccine, reported in 2 meta-analyses Citation were not considered since results were reported as pooled analyses and expressed as IM-MF59 to comparator ratio. However, data from some of the 25 trials herein considered Citation are included in the 2 meta-analyses.\n",
    "For all the 25 trials, with a few exceptions, it was possible to examine numerical data or only fulfillment or not of EMA requirements for elderly people for post-vaccination seroprotection rate, GMTR (except for Baldo 2006 Citation ), and seroconversion rate (except for Del Giudice et al. 2006 Citation and Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation ). Protective HI titers higher than the generally accepted value of 40 were considered by Minutello et al. Citation and De Donato et al. Citation (HI ≥128) and Gasparini et al. (HI ≥160). Citation\n",
    "With regard to responses against A/H3N2 antigen, the requested post-vaccination value of at least 60% of people with HI protective titers was always reached (range 70.8–100%) with 2 exceptions, both considering as protective titers higher than 40, Minutello et al. Citation (third year of observation, 51%) and Gasparini et al. Citation (51%). The requested values of GMTR (≥2) and of seroconversion (≥30%) were always satisfied and ranged from 2.4 to 17.6 and from 30.0 to 92.9%, respectively.\n",
    "The examination of HI titers against A/H1N1 antigen showed that the values of seroprotection were >60% (range 71.6–100%) with the exclusion of the first year of observation for Minutello et al. Citation (22.0%, protective titers ≥128) and for Basileo et al. Citation (40.1%), the values of GMTR >2 (range 2.1–13.7) except for Minutello et al. Citation (1.8, third year of observation) and Gasparini et al. Citation (1.9). The requested value of at least 30% of seroconversion was not reached in 6 instances Citation with percentages ranging from 20.0 to 28.3%, whereas when the percentages were satisfied, they ranged from 32.0 to 94.4%.\n",
    "The responses against B antigen were somewhat lower since the 60% of seroprotected individuals in 7 of the studies (range 35.7–58.2%) Citation and the 30% of seroconversions in 6 of the trials (range 10.0–26.9%) Citation were not reached. When the requested criteria were satisfied the percentages of seroprotected individuals ranged from 63.0 to 100% and seroconversion percentages ranged from 32.8 to 89.0%. The GMTR was always >2 (range 2.1–16.2) with 3 exceptions, Camilloni et al. 2009 Citation (1.8), Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation (1.6).\n",
    "Considering all the studies examined, the results obtained showed that IM-MF59 vaccine met, as requested, in most instances 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria. The worst, but still acceptable results, were obtained by Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen and by Minutello et al. Citation the third year of observation and by Scheifele et al. Citation and Camilloni et al. 2014 Citation against B antigen, when only one of the EMA criteria was satisfied.\n",
    "Table 2 reports HI antibody responses induced following administration of ID vaccine using BD's Soluvia to volunteers aged ≥60 y in the 9 different clinical studies considered in the present review. Citation Citation In the study by Arnou et al. Citation the results over 3 consecutive years were reported and in one study (Ansaldi et al. 2012 Citation ) only the results for A/H3N2 strain were included. The total number of subjects examined was 5035 for A/H3N2 and 5100 for A/H1N1 and B antigens. Some of the clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of different doses of Intanza® and compared the results with other vaccines; however, in our review only the results obtained with Intanza 15mcg® were examined.\n",
    "All the studies satisfied the 3 EMA criteria for the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, with the exception of Basileo et al. Citation against A/H1N1 antigen when only the GMTR value was met. For results satisfying EMA requirements, the seroprotection rate ranged from 71.0 to 98.1% and from 63.0 to 93.1%; the GMTR from 2.6 and 8.2 and from 2.0 to 8.1 and, finally, seroconversion from 33.7 to 71.8% and from 35.2 to 76.3%, respectively for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens. As found for IM-MF59, the HI antibody response induced by B strain was lower. The required 60% of seroprotected volunteers was reached in only some of the studies reporting the results for B strain with values ranging from 66.1 to 100%. Values below 60% were found in the first and second year of Arnou et al. Citation (55.7 and 59.9%, respectively) and in Van Damme et al. Citation The GMTR was in most instances >2 (range 2.5 and 3.7) except in the second year of Arnou et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation (1.6) and Tsang et al. Citation (1.7) studies. Seroconversion rates >30% were found in 6 trials (range 36.4–46.0%). The values of the studies that did not satisfy EMA criteria Citation ranged from 15.8 to 17.2%. In all the years studied, 3 or at least 2 of the EMA immunogenicity criteria were satisfied, except the second year of the study by Arnou et al. Citation when none of the immunogenicity criteria was satisfied and the studies conducted by Van Damme et al., Citation Scheifele et al. Citation and Tsang et al. Citation when only one value was reached. However, Van Damme et al., Citation and Scheifele et al., Citation measured antibody titers using both HI and SRH methods. The study by Van Damme et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using SRH satisfied all 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria not only against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, confirming data observed using HI method, but also against B antigen, against which only one of the 3 criteria was satisfied using HI test. On the other hand, the study of Scheifele et al., Citation showed that the results obtained by using HI method satisfied all 3 EMA criteria against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains and only one against B strain. Conversely, by using SRH method the fulfilled criteria were 2 against A strains and the same one against B strain.\n",
    "A direct comparison of immunogenicity of IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, measuring antibody titers both using HI and SRH methods, was recently reported by Van Damme et al. Citation and by Scheifele et al. Citation who examined elderly people immunized for 2007/2008 and for 2011/2012 Winter seasons, respectively.\n",
    "Van Damme et al. Citation found that there were no differences between the 2 vaccine groups in GMTR, seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains by either HI or SRH method with the exception of seroprotection rate for the A/H1N1 strain. Seroprotection rates were high in both groups, but significantly higher in the IM-MF59 group (differences of 5.8% (0.7–10.9) and 5.8% (1.1–10.5) by HI and SRH method respectively). Moreover, considering an arbitrary definition of non-inferiority (upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals around the post-vaccination ratios of GMT IM-MF59/ID being <1.5), Van Damme et al. Citation demonstrated GMT non inferiority of ID vs. IM-MF59 vaccine for A/H1N1 and B strains with HI method and for all 3 strains with SRH method. In addition, post-hoc analysis to adjust for baseline antibody titers demonstrated ID vaccine non-inferiority using both HI and SRH methods for all 3 strains.\n",
    "Scheifele et al. Citation found that 21 d after vaccination seroprotection rates and GMT values were significantly higher after IM-MF59 vaccine vs. ID vaccine both against A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains when measured by HI and SRH methods, with the exception of seroprotection rates against A/H1N1 measured by SRH method that were similar in the 2 vaccine groups. However, the differences although being statistically significant, were modest. Meaningful response assessment against B vaccine strain was not possible due to the presence of very high baseline titers. Using the same arbitrary definition of non-inferiority used by Van Damme et al, Citation Scheifele et al. Citation found that HI responses against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for ID relative to IM-MF59 vaccine, whereas the results were similar to all 3 vaccine antigens when assessed by SRH.\n",
    "Results obtained by our research group comparing the immunogenicity evaluated as HI antibody induction of IM-MF59 and ID in elderly institutionalized volunteers during the 2011–2012 Citation and the 2012–2013 Citation Winter seasons were recently published. The results observed in the 2011–2012 Winter season, the same examined by Scheifele et al., Citation showed that against A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 antigens both vaccines induced significant comparable increases in HI titers and the responses satisfied all 3 EMA requirements. Against B strain both vaccines stimulated responses lower as compared with the A antigens, moreover the responses were generally higher after ID than IM-MF59 and all 3 EMA criteria were met after ID and only one (seroprotection rate) after IM-MF59. Considering the results of the 2012–2013 winter season Citation both vaccines induced comparable significant HI antibody responses against the 3 vaccine strains. All three EMA criteria were satisfied against A/H3N2 and B antigens, whereas responses against A/H1N1 antigen were somewhat lower since only one criteria was met with both vaccines. Responses against B antigen tended to be higher in subjects vaccinated with ID than those immunized with IM-MF59 vaccine again, as observed in the Winter 2011–2012. Citation\n",
    "Finally, in order to try to have more information about possible differences between IM-MF59 and ID vaccine, immunogenicity data reported for the 2 vaccines in the different studies analyzed in this review were compared. Because of the different years in which IM-MF59 and ID vaccines were commercialized, 1997 and 2010 respectively, the years examined, the vaccine composition and the number of people studied, differ between the 2 vaccines. In order to analyze if differences between the pooled data from the studies analyzed for the 2 vaccines were significant statistically, an hypothesis test was applied. In particular, because of the differences in the data available and because the standard deviation values of the immunogenicity values were prevalently missing, a 2-samples pooled t-test at the α = 5% significance level was selected as the most appropriate hypothesis test. The mean and confidence interval values estimated for the 3 EMA immunogenicity criteria (seroprotection, GMTR and seroconversion) are reported in Figure 1 . Comparing the mean percentages of people who reached the state of seroprotection ( Fig. 1a ) or the mean values of GMTR ( Fig. 1b ) after IM-MF59 and ID vaccination, the data show that, although the mean estimates of the 2 vaccines against the 3 vaccine antigens were different, the confidence intervals were overlapping and all p values were greater than 0.05. As a consequence, the hypothesis that the corresponding true mean values are not significantly different cannot be accepted. Similar results were observed considering the mean seroconversions rate estimates against A/H1N1 and B antigens after the 2 vaccines ( Fig. 1c ). Conversely, confidence intervals of the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 were not overlapping and the p value was smaller than 0.05, suggesting that the hypothesis that the seroconversions mean values against A/H3N2 antigens after IM-MF59 and ID vaccine are not equal, with higher values after IM-MF59 administration with respect to ID.

The horizontal dashed line indicates the EMA threshold level for each parameter.\n",
    "In addition to the suboptimal immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in elderly people, another important limitation of influenza vaccination, during the inter-pandemic periods, is a direct consequence of the antigenic drift due to the accumulation of point mutations on genes encoding the 2 surface proteins, HA and neuraminidase, resulting in changes in the antigenic characteristics of the circulating strains, possibly determining significant mismatches between the latter and the viral variants included in the vaccine, with consequent inadequate protection of vaccines. Citation The availability of influenza vaccines offering a higher and broader immune response than that conferred by conventional formulations could represent a fundamental challenge in the prevention of influenza.\n",
    "Table 3 reports data demonstrating that IM-MF59-adjuvanted and ID vaccines have been found reproducibly to confer cross-reactivity against drifted virus strains in the elderly patients aged ≥60. Citation Citation HI antibody responses against A/H3N2 co-circulating during the winter period studied Citation and A/H3N2 strains recommended as vaccine component for previous or forthcoming winter seasons Citation were found to fulfill in most instances all the 3 or at least 2 EMA immunogenicity criteria both after IM-MF59 Citation or ID Citation vaccine administration.

Citation Induction of cross-reactive HI antibodies against influenza B virus strain was examined only after IM-MF59 vaccination in 3 different studies. Citation Influenza B viruses fall in 2 major antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, co-circulating in some years among the population and currently in many countries only one type B strain, representing one of the 2 lineages, can be incorporated into the vaccine. Citation Increases in HI antibody titers were found against drifted B strains, both belonging to the same or different lineage as compared to vaccine strain. However, the responses prevalently satisfy, both against the vaccine and the drifted strains, only one of the 3 EMA criteria. Table 3.

    "2. Methods\n",
    "The study was conducted utilising the Delphi-type technique to generate group consensus between July and December 2020. The procedure involved a two-stage survey of expert opinion on the impact of antigenic drift and egg adaptation changes on vaccine match (VM) and effectiveness (IVE) and their frequency between the 2014 and 2019 influenza seasons in the EU5 countries. These data were complemented with two systematic literature reviews focused on influenza VM and IVE (for the identical period).\n",

    "2.2. Assessment of Expert Opinion\n",
    "Eleven European influenza experts from five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) were invited to participate in the study via professional networks. The inclusion criteria for the experts were: background and expertise in Public Health, Epidemiology of influenza or Virology, and/or peer-review publications or membership to relevant organisations.\n",
    "In the first survey round (using open-ended questions), experts were asked to provide a mean estimate of the increase of influenza VM and IVE in the absence of antigenic drift or egg adaptations. The responses of each expert were specific to their country and regarded only influenza seasons between 2014 and 2019. The experts were also asked to provide the frequency of the impact of these phenomena on vaccine match and effectiveness for the same period. The answers from all experts were processed using summary statistics to produce estimates at both the country level and European level. In the second survey round, experts were presented with both sets of estimates (country and European levels) and were allowed to revise their responses accordingly. Answers to the second survey were combined utilising summary statistics at country and EU5 level, as well as the EU5 averages estimated by experts for individual countries.\n",
    "An estimated percentage increase in vaccine effectiveness was calculated as an absolute increase (IVE in the absence of antigenic drift, or egg adaptation IVE in the presence of both antigenic drift and egg adaptations). A percentage increase in VM was similarly calculated as an absolute increase. Summary statistics such as mean, and range (minimum, maximum) were used to present the average percentage increase.\n"

Test-negative design studies of influenza VE were eligible if they enrolled outpatients on the basis of predefined illness criteria, reported subtype-level VE by season, used PCR to confirm influenza, and adjusted for age. We excluded studies restricted to hospitalised patients or special populations, duplicate reports, interim reports superseded by a final report, studies of live-attenuated vaccine, and studies of prepandemic seasonal vaccine against H1N1pdm09. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts to identify articles for full review. Discrepancies in inclusion and exclusion criteria and VE estimates were adjudicated by consensus. Outcomes were VE against H3N2, H1N1pdm09, H1N1 (pre-2009), and type B. We calculated pooled VE using a random-effects model.\n",

    "    Determinants of influenza vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Europe: a systematic review - PMC\n",

    "    ===== Abstract =====\n",
    "    Background Pregnant women are at high risk for severe influenza. However, maternal influenza vaccination uptake in most World Health Organization (WHO) European Region countries remains low, despite the presence of widespread national recommendations. An influenza vaccination reduces influenza-associated morbidity and mortality in pregnancy, as well as providing newborns with protection in their first months. Potential determinants of vaccine hesitancy need to be identified to develop strategies that can increase vaccine acceptance and uptake among pregnant women. The primary objective of the systematic review is to identify the individual determinants of influenza vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Europe, and how to overcome the hesitancy.\n",
    "    Methods Databases were searched for peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies published between 2009 and 2019 inclusive. Databases included PubMed via MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, SAGE Journals, Taylor and Francis and Springer nature. These covered themes including psychology, medicine, and public health. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, 11 studies were eligible and analyzed for significant determinants of influenza vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Europe.\n",
    "    Results The most commonly reported factors were psychological aspects, for example concerns about safety and risks to mother and child, or general low risk perception of becoming ill from influenza. Doubts about the effectiveness of the vaccine and a lack of knowledge about this topic were further factors. There was also influence of contextual factors, such as healthcare workers not providing adequate knowledge about the influenza vaccine or the pregnant lady stating their antivaccine sentiment.\n",
    "    Conclusion Health promotion that specifically increases knowledge among pregnant women about influenza and vaccination is important, supporting a valid risk judgment by the pregnant lady. The development of new information strategies for dialogue between healthcare providers and pregnant women should form part of this strategy.\n",

    "                Data synthesis: Five RCTs involving 11,987 participants did not show a significant reduction in VE when participants vaccinated in two consecutive seasons (VE 71%, 95% CI 62–78%) were compared to those vaccinated in the current season (VE 58%, 95% CI 48–66%) (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.62–1.26, p = 0.49, I2 = 39%). Twenty-eight observational studies involving 28,627 participants also did not show a reduction (VE for two consecutive seasons 41%, 95% CI 30–51% compared to VE for current season 47%, 95% CI 39–54%; OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98–1.32, p = 0.09, I2 = 63%). Results from subgroup analyses by influenza type/subtype, vaccine type, age, vaccine match and co-morbidity support these findings;\n",
    "                however, dose–response results were inconsistent. Certainty in the evidence was assessed to be very low due to unexplained heterogeneity and imprecision.\n",
    "                Limitations: The inclusion of studies with relatively small sample sizes and low event rates contributed to the imprecision of summary VE and OR estimates, which were based on unadjusted data. Conclusion: Available evidence does not support a reduction in VE with consecutive influenza vaccination, but the possibility of reduced effectiveness cannot be ruled out due to very low certainty in this evidence.

    "                regarding criteria for study inclusion, outcomes, search methods for identification of studies, data collection, risk of bias, evaluation of the quality of evidence and analysis were established a priori. The PRISMA statement was used to guide reporting of this review MEDLINE (OVID interface, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process &\n",
    "                Other Non-Indexed Citations, 1946 to Present), EMBASE (OVID interface, 1974 to Present) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Search strategies were tailored to each database (Appendix 1A-C of Supplementary Materials). No restrictions based on study design, language or publication date were employed in the searches to minimize publication bias [25]. Included studies were however limited to the English language to facilitate retrieval of full-texts . Searches were conducted on February 9 (MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and February 10 (EMBASE), 2017. Each of the searches was rerun on April 26, 2017 as 4 new relevant publications were identified after completion of the initial searches. Citations of included studies were also reviewed to minimize the risk of failing to include relevant studies. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and\n",
    "                full-texts of records identified by our searches for possible inclusion. If necessary, consensus was reached through discussion amongst the review pair.\n",

    "                was reported were included [28]. All vaccine types were included and were categorized as inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or other (e.g. high-dose vaccine). Laboratory-confirmed influenza, tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture was the primary outcome. Studies\n",
    "                reporting influenza based on any confirmatory laboratory test (PCR, viral culture, rise in antibody titres, immunofluorescence\n",
    "                assay, rapid antigen testing or a combination of these) were included as a secondary outcome since these additional methods have been shown to be inferior in sensitivity and reliability when compared to PCR and viral culture . Influenza was categorized as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 or B whenever possible. Studies reporting the outcome of immunogenicity were not eligible for inclusion because this surrogate measure of vaccine-induced protection may fail to predict the outcome of influenza infection .\n",
    "                Following pilot testing, data related to study characteristics, participant demographics, cases of influenza infection by vaccination group and risk of bias assessment was extracted in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies [33,34]. According to the classifications outlined in the Cochrane risk of bias tool, the following were evaluated in RCTs: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation J.J. Bartoszko et al. / Vaccine 36 (2018) 3434–3444 3435 concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel and other potential threats to validity), detection bias \n",
    "                (blinding of outcome assessment and other potential threats to validity), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data) and reporting bias (selective outcome reporting assessed by comparing outcomes reported in the protocol to those reported in the completed RCT whenever possible). For a given domain, RCTs judged as definitely or probably being free of a given risk of bias were considered low risk of bias, whereas RCTs judged as probably or definitely biased were considered high risk of bias to reduce reporting of unclear bias assessments [33]. The lowest risk of bias in cohort and case control studies corresponded to a maximum of 9 points on the NOS based on the following criteria: selection bias (maximum 4\n",
    "                points), comparability of study groups (maximum 2 points, sex and age considered to be the most important covariates) and ascertainment of exposure or outcome, for case-control or cohort studies, respectively (maximum 3 points) . Differences in data extracted and risk of bias assessments were resolved by discussion between the review pair.\n",
    "                The quality of the evidence overall and the extent to which we are confident in our findings was determined using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation\n",
    "                (GRADE) approach .\n",

VE and 95% CIs were calculated as 100%, for which the comparator was no vaccination [37]. Corresponding\n",
    "                authors of included studies were contacted when missing data or further clarification was needed. Summary effect estimates were derived from raw and unadjusted data.\n",
    "                A random effects model was assumed due to expected heterogeneity between studies. Forest plots were visually inspected to evaluate heterogeneity [38]. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant and indicative of heterogeneity for the Chi2 test. An I2 value of 0–40%, 30–60%, 50–90% or 75–100% was interpreted as not likely important, moderate, substantial or considerable heterogeneity, respectively . Investigation of statistical and clinical heterogeneity was based on a priori subgroups. These included method of laboratory-confirmation (primary compared to secondary), age (17, 18–64, and 65 years old), vaccine type (IIV, LAIV or other), influenza type/subtype causing infection (A/H3N2,\n",
    "                A/H1N1 or B), presence of an underlying chronic illness (presence of at least one co-morbidity compared to no reported comorbidities) and vaccine match (yes or no, based on included\n",
    "                study’s or review team’s judgements of the extent that vaccine strains were matched to those circulating in the community). The dose-response previously observed between number of vaccinations and influenza infection was also explored . Studies of participants not easily categorized were subjected to subgroup analyses so long as it could be inferred that at least 80% of the population of interest met subgroup criteria. Post-hoc subgroup analysis by influenza season to account for seasonal differences other than vaccine match was completed when possible. Sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our results to studies with aggregate data (influenza outcomes pooled across seasons) and imperfect vaccination history (vaccination may not have been immediately in the year prior or pooled across 2 prior years) was also conducted. Studies in which the pandemic H1N1 monovalent vaccine was administered in the year prior to the current season were considered separately as our primary interest was the impact of consecutive seasonal influenza vaccination.\n",
