                                "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) recipients are at an increased risk of infectious complications, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality post-transplant. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end of donors is one of the strategies that has been studied to improve immune reconstitution post-transplant, however the efficacy and safety of this strategy is not well @hit_startreviewed@hit_end in the @hit_startliterature@hit_end. In this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end we sought to evaluate the current strategies of donor @hit_startvaccination@hit_end along with their immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety. Utilizing strict selection criteria with defined MeSH terminology, an electronic search was conducted from the following databases: @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Database of @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end and Scopus. Abstracts of various professional society meetings were also screened and hand searching of various reviews and guideline articles was carried out. The full text of 52 articles were reviewed, from which 5 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria for effectiveness and immunogenicity trials and 1 article was included for safety data. Jadad score was used to assess the quality of included studies. The results of the included studies were inconsistent, and the studies were generally of suboptimal methodological quality. Most of the included studies (n = 3) investigated the use of more than one @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, however not all commonly used @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in HCT were investigated. None of the studies reported any long-term benefits for HCT recipients of @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end donors. Only one study reported safety data of using @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in donors. Given the suboptimal quality of the studies, and questionable effectiveness, donor @hit_startvaccination@hit_end cannot be recommended for all. Prospective high-quality @hit_startvaccine@hit_end trials in HCT donors are needed."

                                "Preventable diseases and late diagnosis of disease impose great clinical and economic burden for health care systems, especially in the current juncture of rising medical expenditures. Under these circumstances, community pharmacies have been identified as accessible venues to receive preventive services. This umbrella review aims to examine existing evidence on the impact of community pharmacist-provided preventive services on clinical, utilization, and economic outcomes in the United States (US). We included @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end, narrative reviews and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end published in English between January 2007 and October 2017. Of 2742 references identified by our search strategy, a total of 13 research syntheses met our inclusion criteria. Included reviews showed that community pharmacists are effective at increasing @hit_startimmunization@hit_end rates, supporting smoking cessation, managing hormonal contraception therapies, and identifying patients at high risk for certain diseases. Moreover, evidence suggests that community pharmacies are especially well-positioned for the provision of preventive services due to their convenient location and extended hours of operation. There is general agreement on the positive impact of community pharmacists in increasing access to preventive health, particularly among patients who otherwise would not be reached by other healthcare providers. The provision of preventive services at US community pharmacies is feasible and effective, and has potential for improving patient outcomes and health system efficiency. However, high-quality evidence is still lacking. As the healthcare landscape shifts towards a value-based framework, it will be important to conduct robust studies that further evaluate the impact of community pharmacist-provided preventive services on utilization and economic outcomes."

                                "Purpose: The purpose of this article is to assemble, review, and provide a synopsis of the historical and current literature regarding optimal sequencing of radiation (RT) and immunotherapy combination treatments. Materials and methods: A @hit_startreview@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end was performed using @hit_startPubMed@hit_end with the query \u201cradiation\u201d and \u201cImmunotherapy\u201d, \u201cPD1\u201d, \u201cPDL1\u201d, \u201cCTLA4\u201d, \u201cOX40\u201d, \u201ccheckpoint\u201d, \u201c@hit_startvaccine@hit_end\u201d, \u201cmacrophage\u201d, \u201cSTING\u201d, and \u201cTGFbeta\u201d. Studies that included sequencing of therapy were evaluated and the studies were included at the authors discretion. Results: A paucity of primary literature exists examining the best order of radiation and immunotherapy, most of which was performed in the pre-clinical setting. The observations are that optimal sequencing of various radiation plus immune therapy combinations is dependent on the mechanism(s) of activation by the combination treatment. Immunosuppressive molecules tend to be better inhibited prior to RT while engagement of costimulatory genes is better activated concomitantly with RT. Conclusions: These data should compel more basic research into both the direct investigation of sequencing efficacy and studies on the mechanisms of immune mediated cell death potentiated by radio-therapy."

                                "The concept of antibody based therapy hints on two concepts, on the one hand precluding the function of the ligand it binds to, which is for instance the case in VEGF targeting antibodies. And on the other hand the induction of antibody dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC) which may be induced by these antibodies. The latter is caused by activation of the immune system after an antibody binds to its ligand. Here I will focus on the role of antibodies targeting the immune checkpoints. Immunotherapy is now considered a standard treatment in many malignancies. Also in mesothelioma, different antibodies are now being explored [Yap 2017]. The most clinically used type of immunotherapy in oncology are checkpoint inhibitors, mostly PD-(l)1 and CTLA-4 directed antibodies. Concerning the latter, a recently published randomised trial failed to show an benefit of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremilimumab, compared to placebo in second and third line treatment in mesothelioma [Maio 2017]. Small and single arm studies on PD-(l)1 have been presented and did show clinical meaningful responses in patients. However this was only present in a minority of patients [Lievense 2017]. The role of ADCC in the functioning of the antibodies is not well established nor investigated, but for instance a regulatory T-cell depletion due to CTLA-4 antibodies has been described. The lack of benefit in the majority of patients is ascribed to the absence of a tumor directed T-cell response present in the majority of mesothelioma patients [Aerts 2013, Yap 2017]. This lack of tumor directed T-cells is related to the immunosuppressive environment caused by mesothelioma. One way of increasing the tumor directed T-cell responses is via @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. However in thoracic malignancies the effects of peptide @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end were found to be rather limited again due to the immunosuppressive environment created by the tumor. Cellular @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end were found to be more effective in this setting [Dammeijer 2016]. In mesothelioma studies on cellular @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with dendritic cell @hit_startvaccination@hit_end have indeed shown that an increase in tumor directed T-cells can be achieved with clinically relevant responses [Le 2012, Peikert 2016, Aerts 2018]. This concept is now taken forward in a large randomised trial comparing dendritic cell @hit_startvaccination@hit_end with best supportive care as maintenance treatment after chemotherapy in patients with mesothelioma. In conclusion antibody based therapy and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end hold promise in mesothelioma, and given the dismal prognosis of these patients these options should be investigated and explored further.

                                "Objectives: @hit_startVaccines@hit_end against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) are included in the current UK childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedule. Our aim was to provide an overview of recent data around the epidemiology and clinical burden of these diseases in the UK. Methods: Systematic searches for publications reporting incidence, prevalence, and risk factors were conducted in September 2017 using @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, four key conferences (2015-2017), additional sources/websites, and by hand-searching references of included publications. There was no restriction on intervention or comparator. Only English-language publications from 2012 onwards were included. Results: Of the 11,451 publications identified, 38 (reporting on 37 studies) were included; 21 studies reported data on Hep B, eight on pertussis, five on H. influenzae, and one each on diphtheria, tetanus, and poliomyelitis. Incidence and prevalence of Hep B are low overall; those born overseas or of Asian ethnicity were at higher risk than the general population. People who inject drugs (psychoactive or image- and performance-enhancing) represent another risk group for Hep B. In 2012, there was a resurgence of pertussis primarily in very young infants; this was successfully addressed by a programme of maternal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy. Due to the effective control of Hib after two decades of routine @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, non-b serotypes now cause a large percentage of the remaining low H. influenzae morbidity and mortality in the UK; risk groups included expectant mothers, young infants, and adults with comorbidities or immunosuppression. The low number of studies and reported cases of diphtheria, tetanus and polio suggest that these diseases are well controlled. Conclusions: While the childhood @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedule continues to be highly effective, certain population subgroups are at risk of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end hepatitis B and pertussis infections. This highlights the on-going importance of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in conjunction with high population @hit_startvaccine@hit_end coverage rates."

                                "Objectives: Rotavirus is a common cause of severe diarrhea in children under five. Two types of rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (i.e., RV1 and RV5) have been introduced and used on a voluntary basis in South Korea. We conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end (SR) on economic evaluation (EE) of rotavirus @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (RV). Methods: We searched for previous SR studies of EE for RV in August 2017 using databases such as @hit_startMedline@hit_end and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end. After identifying SR studies, additional search was performed to include literatures published after or unincluded in the previous SR. Among the 11 SR studies identified, a study by Kotirum et al (2017) was selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment by A MeaSurement Tool to Assess @hit_startsystematic Reviews@hit_end. A total of 104 original articles were included in the Kotirum\u2019s study. Among the 36 original articles identified through additional search, 10 were selected, resulting in 114 studies included in our @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Results: About 44% of the studies evaluated RV1 only, 22% RV5 only, and 33% both. The proportion of the studies concluding RV as being cost-effective were 90% when evaluating RV1 only, 64% RV5 only, and 68% both. Whereas RV5-only studies were performed usually in high-income countries (68%), RV1-only studies were performed mainly in lower middle-income (32%) and upper middle-income countries (26%). Majority of RV1-only studies (82%; 28 of 34 studies specifying funding sources) were funded by non-profit organization, and 100% of these studies were concluded as being cost-effective. RV5-only studies were mostly funded by profit organization (68%; 13 of 19 studies specifying sources), and 92% of these studies concluded as being cost-effective. Conclusions: Characteristics of global EE studies for RV were assessed in this study. Our @hit_startanalysis@hit_end would be helpful to support policy decision for adopting RV in National @hit_startImmunization@hit_end Program in South Korea."

                                "Objectives: @hit_startVaccination@hit_end is a crucial public health strategy, particularly when considering paediatric @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end programmes. Cost-effectiveness, in conjunction with clinical effectiveness, are key criteria for determining population access to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end programmes. Our aim was to provide an overview of recent economic @hit_startanalyses@hit_end around @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Methods: Systematic searches for publications on economic @hit_startanalyses@hit_end around @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end for the diseases listed were conducted in September 2017, in @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library, four key conferences (2015\u20132017), by hand-searching references of included publications, and additional sources/websites. English-language publications from 2012 onwards, without country-restriction, were included. Results: Of the 7,659 publications identified, 43 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Sixteen publications were on Hib, 14 on Hep B, 12 on pertussis, and one on poliomyelitis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Four studies (US, Asia, and Africa) found that a birth dose of Hep B @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, or of Hep B immunoglobulin, were cost-effective measures to prevent perinatal transmission. Infant, adult, and catch-up Hep B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schemes were found to be cost-effective in five studies (Asia). To prevent infant pertussis infections, cocooning or @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of pregnant women was only cost-effective under specific circumstances (n=4). For pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in adolescents, evidence is conflicting: a Japanese and US study found it only cost-effective under certain conditions, whereas a Dutch study came to a favourable conclusion. US studies in adults/older adults, found booster @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end to be cost-effective. In low- and middle-income countries, childhood Hib @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is considered cost-effective or cost-saving (n=7). Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of childhood @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end has been tested in different settings and regions and is consistently considered to be highly cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of additional doses (birth doses, catch-up doses, or adult doses) is dependent on the setting. The findings herein highlight the important value of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end as part of wider public health strategies."

                                "Objectives: To review the history of yellow fever since its first description, and to identify the current situation of the disease and the new challenges for Latin American countries\u2019 health systems. Methods: We conducted a @hit_startreview@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end in @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and Lilacs, using free terms as \u201cYellow Fever\u201d and \u201cLatin America\u201d (and every country therein), without language or publication date limits. We also collected information on official PAHO and Ministry of Health figures, since 1950. Results: The review process resulted in the inclusion of 29 articles and documents. The study describes chronologically the history of yellow fever in Colombia, the periods and distribution of the important epidemics, the importance of identifying its vectors and the new challenges that the isolated outbreaks bring to the health systems of Latin American countries. Yellow fever has played an important role in Colombian history since its arrival in the mid-seventeenth century. First were the epidemics in the Caribbean ports; then, with steam navigation, the disease traveled upstream, along the main rivers, especially the Magdalena. Both the identification of the vectors involved in its transmission, and the development of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, lead to its control in major cities, and displaced the disease interest to the background. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that shows that the outbreaks of sporadic yellow fever epidemics continued to occur in remote regions, with a peak in 2016, in parallel with what occurred in neighboring countries such as Peru and Brazil. The main vector, Aedes aegypti, involved in the transmission of other arboviruses, adapts to new environments and proliferates in many urban settings. There is, however a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end of a relative low cost and high effectiveness that could contribute to the eradication of the disease."

                                "Objectives: Cervical cancer is the sixth leading cancer among European women. Country-specific data on costs of management of HPV-related cervical lesions and cancers are important for decision-makers to determine the value of public health interventions including screening and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. We compiled published information on screening and management costs of HPV-related cervical diseases in Europe. Methods: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end/@hit_startEMBASE@hit_end were systematically searched for cost-of-illness studies, published from February 2013\u2013October 2017, reporting on country-level economic burden of screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of HPV-related cervical lesions (intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ and minor cytological abnormalities) and cancers among the general European population. Key exclusion criteria were limited age range (<25 or >45 years only), not English, and patient or regional level data only. Data extracted included, costing year, sources and types of costs and population information. Results: Out of 2,625 studies screened, five (from Belgium, Finland, Poland and Sweden) met the inclusion criteria; only one estimated indirect costs. Annual direct costs of cervical cancer screening were 22.6\u20ac million in Belgium, 30.7\u20ac million in Finland 45.9zl (11.2\u20ac) million in Poland, and 49.8\u20ac million in Sweden. Women aged 25-44 years represented 40% (22.4\u20ac million) of the screening costs in Finland. Annual direct costs of diagnosis and treatment of cervical lesions were 6.8\u20ac million in Finland, 69.0zl (16.8\u20ac) million in Poland, and 5.2\u20ac million in Sweden. Annual direct costs of diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer were 3.6\u20ac million in Finland, 52.4zl (12.8\u20ac) million in Poland, and \u20ac18.1 million in Sweden. In Sweden, indirect costs (productivity losses) were 18.1\u20ac, 0.8\u20ac and 4.8\u20ac.million for screening, management of cervical lesions and cancers, respectively. Conclusions: Although majority of costs associated with cervical cancer detection and treatment in developed countries are attributable to cervical cancer screening, follow up of abnormal cytology results to prevent disease progression consumes substantial healthcare resources."

                                "Objectives: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only licensed @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for tuberculosis. However its effectiveness is shown to be variable depending on age of the recipient and the geographical settings. A valid cost effectiveness study is needed to help decision makers implementing the most cost-effective strategy for BCG @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. The aim of this study is to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end the outcomes of the pharmacoeconomic studies of BCG @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and assess the quality and consistency of the study results. Methods: We comprehensively searched @hit_startPUBMED@hit_end and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end. We included studies that performed economic evaluation on BCG @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and were written in English. We used the Quality of Health Economic Studies(QHES) instrument to assess the quality of the included studies. Results: Twenty-one articles were included in the review. There was a high level of heterogeneity of applying BCG-@hit_startvaccine@hit_end within the studies regarding specific strategies followed, participants, type of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, comparators, and study designs. Thirteen studies evaluated universal strategy, six studies evaluated targeted or otherwise specific strategies, and the remaining articles assessed revaccination strategies. Most of the studies evaluated licensed BCG-@hit_startvaccines@hit_end in the market while four articles assessed the effectiveness of hypothetical @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. The quality of the studies varied, but the majority were of high to satisfactory quality. However, not all studies used optimal sources for the input parameters. Additionally, the potential of bias, probably interfering with the results, was rarely discussed. Conclusions: Most of the studies showed a favorable economic profile of BCG @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. A selective strategy seems most cost effective to be applied in low incidence areas. Varying results on revaccination strategies could not lead to a conclusive finding on the cost effectiveness of BCG @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Future economic evaluations should better consider optimal sources for input parameters and cover the issue of potential bias in results."
