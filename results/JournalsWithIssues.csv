51,"EMBASE, MEDLINE, unknown",Review,English,,Addressing vaccine hesitancy,"Objective To provide primary care physicians with clinical guidance for addressing parental vaccine hesitancy. Sources of information The PubMed database was searched for English-language articles published in the 10 years before January 1, 2018. Search terms included vaccine hesitancy or confidence or acceptance, parents or children, and communication, counseling, or clinical practice. References of identified articles were assessed for additional relevant articles. A separate gray literature search was conducted using Google to find best-practice guidelines from public health and health care organizations, knowledge translation materials for health care providers, and resources that could be used in discussions with parents about vaccines. Main message Practical tips for addressing parental vaccine hesitancy in primary care include starting early, presenting vaccination as the default approach, building trust, being honest about side effects, providing reassurance on a robust vaccine safety system, focusing on protection of the child and community, telling stories, and addressing pain. Also provided are statements that providers could use in vaccination-related conversations; answers to commonly asked questions on benefits, safety, and immunologic aspects of vaccines; and links to a number of online resources for physicians and parents. Conclusion Vaccine-hesitant parents who are on the fence far outnumber vaccine refusers; therefore, counseling this group might be more effective. Reasons behind vaccine hesitancy are complex and encompass more than just a knowledge deficit. As a trusted source of information on vaccines, family physicians play a key role in driving vaccine acceptance.",Canadian Family Physician,2019,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2019', 'month': '03', 'day': '01', 'content': '2019-03-01'}}","Canada, child protection, clinical practice, community care, conversation, drug safety, general practitioner, honesty, human, parent counseling, parental attitude, practice guideline, primary medical care, reassurance, review, trust, vaccination, vaccine hesitancy","[{'ancestor': ['canada', 'geographic names', 'north america', 'western hemisphere']}, {'ancestor': ['child protection', 'child welfare', 'society', 'society and environment', 'welfare']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical practice', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care facilities and services', 'health care organization', 'health service', 'medical care', 'professional practice']}, {'ancestor': ['care and caring', 'community care', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'social aspects and related phenomena', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'cognition', 'conversation', 'interpersonal communication', 'language ability', 'mental function', 'mental performance', 'motor activity', 'psychomotor activity', 'social behavior', 'verbal behavior', 'verbal communication']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug safety', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['general practitioner', 'health care concepts', 'health care personnel', 'medical personnel', 'named groups by occupation', 'named groups of persons', 'physician']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'honesty', 'mental function', 'personality']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['counseling', 'medical procedures', 'parent counseling', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['attitude', 'behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'family attitude', 'parental attitude']}, {'ancestor': ['disease management', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'methodology', 'practice guideline', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'medical care', 'primary health care', 'primary medical care']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'reassurance', 'social behavior']}, {'ancestor': ['@hit_startreview@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'human relation', 'social behavior', 'trust']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['attitude', 'behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'human relation', 'patient attitude', 'social behavior', 'vaccine hesitancy']}]","[{'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Shen'}, {'initials': 'V.', 'surname': 'Dubey'}]",Canada,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

These infectious agents show a wide spectrum of resistance against different antimicrobial drugs which causes a major public health threat all over the world. In recent years bacteria, fungi, virus, and parasites started to show prominent levels of multidrug-resistance with superior morbidity and mortality. MDR Salmonellosis requires costly drugs for effective treatment, and this is an added burden to the health-care segment in developing countries. Immunization in common areas with typhoid vaccine, rational use of antibiotic, improvement in public sanitation facilities, secure food handling and communal health instruction were considered to be as vital in the prevention of salmonellosis. These health and environmental issues require collective actions from governments, consumers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and health-care providers.

86,EMBASE,Article,English,"Hepatitis B virus vaccine, Hepatitis immunity, Immunologic response",Management approaches to hepatitis B virus vaccination nonresponse,"Background: Despite the availability of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, HBV remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Immunologic response and the development of immunity to the HBV vaccine vary significantly among patients. Multiple studies have looked at patients who are at risk of nonresponse and have offered their own approaches to patients who do not respond. This article reviews the best approaches to HBV vaccine nonresponse. Methods: We searched the PubMed database for all articles on HBV vaccination response from 1981 to January 2018. Recommended and tested approaches to nonresponse were identified. Results: A total of 71 adequate-quality studies with 2354 patients were identified. Repeat vaccination with the same dose increased immunologic seroconversion in 85.7% of patients who previously reported nonresponse and in over 80% of patients with end-stage renal disease, HIV infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, advanced age, hypoalbuminemia, liver cirrhosis, and hemodialysis (HD) dependence. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and diabetes had a milder response (67.5%). Increasing the vaccination dose to 40 ∂Êg improved seroconversion in HIV-infected, HCV-infected, and HD patients of initial nonresponse. The use of a subcutaneous injection route increased response by 12% in patients infected with HIV. Conclusion: Patients not responding to an initial vaccine series and not actively infected with HBV benefited from reimmu-nization by repeating the vaccine series or receiving a single-dose vaccine booster. Although the overall response rate was approximately 90% of previous nonresponders, the rate varied among the populations studied.",Gastroenterology and Hepatology,2019,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2019', 'month': '02', 'day': '01', 'content': '2019-02-01'}}","article, hemodialysis, Hepatitis B virus, human, seroconversion, systematic review, treatment response, vaccination","[{'ancestor': ['article', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['chemical procedures', 'dialysis', 'extracorporeal therapy', 'hemodialysis', 'investigative procedures', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'renal replacement therapy', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['double-stranded dna reverse transcribing virus', 'hepadnaviridae', 'hepatitis b virus', 'hepatitis virus', 'organism forms', 'organisms', 'orthohepadnavirus', 'reverse transcribing virus', 'virus', 'virus forms']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning organ systems', 'immunity', 'microbial immunity', 'seroconversion']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy', 'treatment response']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}]","[{'initials': 'B.', 'surname': 'Yanny'}, {'initials': 'P.', 'surname': 'Konyn'}, {'initials': 'L.M.', 'surname': 'Najarian'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Mitry'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Saab'}]",United States,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

94,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Epidemiological trends of HPV-related anal cancers amongst males globally: A systematic literature review,"Background: Anal cancer is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, which can be prevented by the HPV vaccination. Few countries do recommend vaccination for the male population, but all males are at risk of contracting HPV This study aimed to identify the latest evidence on the incidence of anal cancer and precancer related to HPV in males globally and to analyze the epidemiological trends. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using Medline and EMBASE. Studies containing original anal cancer incidence data in males published between January 1, 2008 and March 23, 2018 in English were included.Results: The global incidence of anal cancers and pre-cancers among the general male population was identified in 25 studies with observations ranging between 1968 and 2014. Incidence over time was reported in Australia and Europe. In an Australian national study, anal cancer incidence increased from 0.77 to 1.3 per 100,000 persons from 1982-2005, and in the UK from 0.79 to 1.06 per 100,000 persons from 1962-2002. In Denmark, the anal cancer range increased from 0.20-0.41 to 0.69-1.3 per 100,000 person-years (PYs) from pre-2000 to post-2000, and in France from 0.2 to 0.5 per 100,000 PYs from 1982-2012. In two national US studies, the mean incidence of pre-cancers was 1.5 in the period 1997-2009, and 0.41 from 1978-2007 per 100,000 PYs. The burden of anal cancers and pre-cancers increased the most among high-risk males reported in US studies. For HIV-positive males, mean incidence of cancer increased from 10.5 during 1980-1989 to 42.3 in 1996-2004 per 100,000 PYs, and for HIV-positive MSM, incidence increased from 47 to 270 per 100,000 PYs between 1984 and 2013. The mean pre-cancer incidence among HIV-positive males increased from 1.7 during 1980-1989 to 29.5 in 1996-2004 per 100,000 PYs. Conclusions: This systematic literature review demonstrates the increase in anal cancer and pre-cancer incidences over time in men, especially in high-risk male populations. The burden of anal cancers and pre-cancers increase over time in all male populations highlights the unmet medical need and the importance of preventative interventions such as HPV gender-neutral vaccinations.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,2019,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2019', 'month': '02', 'day': '01', 'content': '2019-02-01'}}","adult, Australia, cancer incidence, conference abstract, Denmark, Embase, female, France, gender, human, Human immunodeficiency virus, male, Medline, nonhuman, systematic review, vaccination, Wart virus","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['australia', 'australia and new zealand', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer incidence', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'incidence', 'medical parameters', 'oncological parameters', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['denmark', 'eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names', 'scandinavia', 'western europe']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'embase', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'france', 'geographic names', 'western europe']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'gender', 'gender and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['human immunodeficiency virus', 'lentivirus', 'organisms', 'primate lentivirus', 'retroviridae', 'reverse transcribing virus', 'single-stranded rna reverse transcribing virus', 'virus']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['dna virus', 'double-stranded dna virus', 'organisms', 'papillomaviridae', 'papovavirus', 'virus', 'wart virus']}]","[{'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Walia'}, {'initials': 'X.', 'surname': 'Wang'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Nicholson'}, {'initials': 'L.', 'surname': 'Sun'}, {'initials': 'J.R.', 'surname': 'Wong'}, {'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Eriksson'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Kothari'}, {'initials': 'E.', 'surname': 'Morais'}]",,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

216,MEDLINE,Review,English,,"Update in Herpes Zoster Prevention and the Role
of Dermatologists","A recombinant vaccine (HZ/su) was approved in 2017 to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) infection and associated sequelae with greater efficacy and safety than its live precursor. Though dermatologists regularly encounter patients with HZ infection, recommendation of vaccination by dermatologists and other physicians has been minimal in past years. Overall patient awareness and utilization of the HZ vaccines has subsequently been low. While HZ/su touts several improvements over the live vaccine, dermatologists still face obstacles to vaccine recommendation and administration including concerns of efficacy, limited availability, and complex cost and reimbursement for administration. Additionally, dermatologists have not historically played a systematic role in the recommendation and administration of vaccines. A review of literature was completed to identify the current role of dermatologists in HZ prevention, the efficacy and safety of HZ/su, potential barriers to recommendation by dermatologists, and the feasibility of vaccine administration in dermatology offices. Pubmed/MEDLINE was used as the primary search database. Ultimately, widespread encouragement of dermatologists to recommend vaccination against HZ is crucial, and dermatologists are in a prime position to make the vaccine more accessible to their patient population.

246,EMBASE,Review,French,"Algeria, Cervical Cancer, Epidemiology, Morocco, Prevention, Program, Screening, Tunisia","Cervical cancer in the maghreb country (Morocco-Algeria-Tunisia): Epidemiological, clinical profile and control policy","Introduction: Cervical cancer is a public health problem in the Maghreb countries with high mortality and socio-economic impact. The objective of this subject is exposed the epidemiological profile, programs of prevention and the support of cervical cancer in Maghreb (Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria). Methods: To implement this work, we carried out research on morbidity and mortality; cancer plans for Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia); cervical cancer surveillance for each country; the prevention programs of cervical cancer including vaccination, screening, information campaigns, awareness and education; and research conducted in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. We interviewed databases (Pubmed, Sciences Direct etc.), ministerial website, World Health Organization website, foundations website and centers of cancer research. Results: The cervical cancer (CC) is diagnosed at advanced stages. The majority of patients are in advanced stages (stage II, III and IV). Regarding the histological profile squamous cell carcinoma is predominant. HPV 16 and HPV 18 single or multiple infection are by far the most common types of HPV associated with CCU in the Maghreb countries concerning the microbiological profile. All three countries have set up a cancer plans to prevent and control this disease and these impacts. Among the strong points of health policy in cancerology, in all three countries, we raised the existence of a cancer registry for monitoring and evolution of disease. Regarding the prevention of CC, in the three Maghreb countries, there is no primary prevention program (HPV vaccine and the struggle against risk factors), much deficiencies about secondary and tertiary prevention. Conclusion: To win the fight against the CC, the Maghreb countries are called to strengthen the health system globally, to consolidate the national policy and the national guidelines to fight against the CC and to allocate the financial and technical resources to support the implementation policy and guidelines to make services accessible and affordable for women and girls.",Tunisie Medicale,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '10', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-10-01'}}","awareness, cancer epidemiology, cancer research, cancer staging, female, health care policy, histology, human, morbidity, mortality, review, secondary prevention, tertiary prevention, vaccination, World Health Organization","[{'ancestor': ['attention', 'awareness', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'cognition', 'mental function', 'psychophysiology']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer epidemiology', 'diseases', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'cancer research', 'medical procedures', 'medical research', 'oncological procedure', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'research', 'science in general']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer staging', 'classification', 'coding and classification', 'controlled vocabulary', 'diagnosis', 'diagnostic procedure', 'disease classification', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease', 'medical procedures', 'medical terminology', 'oncological procedure', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'tumor classification', 'tumor diagnosis']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['health care concepts', 'health care organization', 'health care policy', 'health care system', 'organization', 'organization and management', 'planning', 'policy', 'public policy', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['diagnostic procedure', 'histology', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'morbidity', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mortality', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['@hit_startreview@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'secondary prevention']}, {'ancestor': ['prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'tertiary prevention']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['governmental organization', 'health care concepts', 'health care organization', 'intergovernmental organization', 'international cooperation', 'international organization', 'organization', 'organization and management', 'society', 'society and environment', 'united nations', 'world health organization']}]","[{'initials': 'I.', 'surname': 'Yazghich'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Berraho'}]",Morocco,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

258,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Managing influenza outbreaks in long-term care facilities,"OBJECTIVE: During influenza season some long-term care (LTC) residents develop influenza despite appropriate resident and health care worker vaccination. Residents are at risk for severe illness during outbreaks. To provide current guidelines for LTC influenza outbreak management, focusing on the pharmacist's role in management, particularly regarding oseltamivir use and potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). METHODS: Literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Association for Professionals in Infection Control (APIC) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) websites. RESULTS: Preventing influenza and controlling outbreaks necessitates a team of administrators, nurses, pharmacists, physicians and other health care workers to provide appropriate vaccination, surveillance, infection control, testing, and therapy. The CDC, APIC and CMS recommend antiviral treatment for residents with confirmed or suspected influenza and antiviral chemoprophylaxis for non-ill residents exposed during outbreaks. Oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir were the antivirals recommended for the 2017-2018 season. Oseltamivir has been the prescribed antiviral in LTC despite mixed reports of effectiveness in residents. Treatment should begin within 48 hours of symptom onset or exposure. Oseltamivir dosage should be decreased for patients with creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute and it's not recommended for end stage renal disease patients not on dialysis. The most common oseltamivir prophylaxis/ treatment ADRs reported were nausea, vomiting, headache and pain but neuropsychiatric ADRs of hallucinations, abnormal behavior, confused state, and delirium have occurred, resulting in discontinuation in some cases. Of 10,218 cumulative ADRs reported to the FDA, 2,412 were psychiatric and 2,019 were nervous system; 12% of the cumulative reports involved patients aged 65 and older. CONCLUSION: The LTC pharmacist can play a key role in influenza management by helping identify outbreaks, distributing medication in a timely manner, providing information regarding oseltamivir benefits/risks and dosages, identifying potential ADRs, and suggesting discontinuation when warranted.",Consultant Pharmacist,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '10', 'day': '01', 'content':

260,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Guinea-worm disease. A systematic review of case reports about the first neglected tropical disease to be eradicated,"Guinea-worm disease is a parasitic disease caused by Dracunculus medinensis. It affects people living in rural and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources for drinking water. Although it mortality is low, morbidity is considerably high and may cause huge disabilities which are devastating. Diagnosis is clinically performed, and no specific treatment nor vaccines are available. The objective of our review was to describe the epidemiology of Guinea-worm disease published cases. A systematic review was conducted following the É??PRISMAÉ?ù guideline. PubMed database was searched using the search terms É??DracunculiasisÉ?ù or É??Guinea-worm diseaseÉ?ù and limited to case reports published in English or Spanish, but without time frame. Full text articles were assessed for relevance and data extraction was performed as an iterative process. During the initial search 26 articles were obtained, from which 19, containing 25 cases were included. Females were more affected than males (13 vs 12) and the medium age of presentation was of 25 years (+/-SD 16.69). The 67% of the patients came from Africa and Nigeria was the country which reported the most (36%). Pain (60%), swelling (36%) and fever (16%) were the most common initial clinical manifestations, and the presence of an ulcer containing the Guinea-worm was found during physical examination in only 40% of the cases. Diagnosis was most commonly done through histopathology (56%). Surgery was performed in 48% of the cases and mechanical extraction in 36%. The decision to do not perform no treatment at all was taken in 16% of the cases. Mortality rate was of 4%. Guinea-worm disease has been set as the first neglected tropical disease to be eradicated, and as it seems to come to an end, there are few case reports published in the literature. We consider that the trends presented in our systematic review, rather than being analyzed from a historic point of view, should be taken as a lesson by health professionals to enhance the active surveillance of the remaining cases. No patient should be left behind and reemergence must be prevented.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '10', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-10-01'}}","adult, animal model, conference abstract, data extraction, female, histopathology, human, male, Medline, mortality rate, Nigeria, nonhuman, physical examination, practice guideline, systematic review","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['animal model', 'biological model', 'model', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['data extraction', 'data processing', 'information', 'information processing', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'biomedicine', 'histopathology', 'medicine', 'pathological anatomy', 'pathology']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mortality', 'mortality rate', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['africa', 'africa south of the sahara', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names', 'nigeria']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['diagnosis', 'diagnostic procedure', 'medical procedures', 'physical examination', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['disease management', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'methodology', 'practice guideline', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}]","[{'initials': 'D.A.A.', 'surname': 'Hern«≠ndez'}, {'initials': 'R.G.', 'surname': 'D«az Arana'}, {'initials': 'A.M.G.', 'surname': 'Ch«≠vez'}, {'initials': 'A.A.', 'surname': 'Macouzet'}, {'initials': 'R.V.', 'surname': 'L«¸pez'}, {'initials': 'A.M.F.', 'surname': 'Presas'}]",Mexico,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

261,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Global risk assessment of travel-related yellow fever spread: A systematic review,"Yellow fever (YF) virus is a flavivirus endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. However, due to a rapid increase in trade and travel volume globally, there is an increased risk of importation of YF to non-endemic areas. We systematically review data from travel-associated YF to help estimate the international risk of YF spread into non-endemic areas. PubMed, ProMed, and online repositories from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organization databases were searched from inception to March 2018. We included all reports describing travel-related YF acquired in endemic countries. Variables of interest were extracted and plotted in Tableau software. We identified 497 unique publications and included 25. Between 1924 and 2018, 38 travel-associated YF cases have been reported. European and non-European-travelers accounted for 16 (42.1%) and 22 (57.9%) of the subjects, respectively. The countries that reported the most cases of imported YF cases were China (28.9%), USA (13.2%) and France (13.2%). Forty-two percent of the importation countries had competent YF vectors, but autochthonous YF transmission in the non-endemic area did not occur. Travelers acquired the disease in South America (56.8%) and Africa (42.2%). Brazil (38.9%), Angola (30.6%), Peru (8.3%), and Senegal (5.6%) were the countries most visited among travelers where YF was acquired. The traveler's mean age was 39.4 ∂Ò 12.4 years, and males predominated (76.7%). All except two (5.3%) were unvaccinated. YF was diagnosed with molecular assays (48.1%), a combination of assays (37%), and serology (7.4%). Hospitalization data was available for 32 (84.2%) cases, and of those 31 (96.9%) were admitted and 7 (58.3%) went to ICU care. Fifteen (48.4%) patients died from their illness. In conclusion, nonimmunized travelers are at-risk of YF complications and capable of seeding local transmission in their countries.

262,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Effect of the ABO blood group on susceptibility to severe malaria and related outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Understanding how the ABO blood group interacts with Plasmodium falciparum malaria will provide insights on the pathogenesis of falciparum malaria and provide direction for basic research that may help the development of novel antimalarial treatments and vaccines. Specifically, investigating the genetic basis that reduces susceptibility to severe P. falciparum infection may lead the formulation of personalized strategies designed to prevent deaths due to severe P. falciparum infection. We systematically summarized information on the effect of ABO blood group on severe P. falciparum infection, level of parasitemia and hemoglobin. We searched literature published in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, CNAHL and Cochrane Library from inception to February 04, 2017 without restriction. We retrieved 1,923 articles were from five databases: Embase (n=728), PubMed (n=620), Web of Science (n=549), CINAHL (n=14) and Cochrane Library (n=12). After removal of duplicates and two levels of screening, we selected 24 articles for inclusion in the systematic review and 22 for the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 15 studies showed an increased odds of severe P. falciparum infection (vs uncomplicated P. falciparum infection) among individuals with blood group A (summary Odds Ratio [OR] 1.34; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.06, 1.62); B (OR 1.48; 95%CI:1.16, 1.79); AB (OR 1.43; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.87); or non-O (A, B or AB) (OR 1.61; 95%CI: 1.31, 1.91) compared with blood group O. A meta-analysis of four studies showed a significantly greater level of P. falciparum parasitemia among individuals with blood group A than those of blood group O (mean difference: 1769.2; 95%CI: 848.9, 2689.4). However, a meta-analysis of four studies showed lack of significant difference in hemoglobin level among P. falciparum infected individuals of blood group A as compared with those of blood group O.

263,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,"Safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of dengue vaccines: Systematic review and network meta analysis of randomized controlled trials","Dengue virus is a global health problem. Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (CYDTDV) was the first vaccine to gain regulatory approval to try and address this problem. There is an urgent need for an effective and safe dengue vaccine to reduce morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population given the lack of specific treatment at present. A safe vaccine that protects against Dengue virus diseases is a global health priority. This review and network meta-analysis aimed to summarize all available evidence on the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of four serotypes of all available types of dengue vaccines. The data is gathered from randomized controlled clinical trial from 13 databases. The Protocol was registered at PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42016052578. Studies that reported the efficacy and immunogenicity of vaccines in the prevention of dengue virus infection and effects on the severity of the disease were included in this review with no restriction to language. Data was extracted by three independent authors. Data were analyzed by R software. Out of 518 studies identified by the electronic and manual search, 44 studies were included in our systematic review and network meta-analysis. Vaccines used were CYD-TDV, TDV, AvP TDV, TDENV PIV, TDEN F17, TDEN F19, TV003-TV005, WRAIR& GSK vaccine DEN1, DEN2 and DEN4 versus controls which were placebo or other vaccines such as meningococcal polysaccharide A+C, typhoid VI polysaccharides, varicella etc. Regarding risk ratio (RR) of injection site swelling, arthralgia, and fatigue in vaccine groups; results were insignificant in network meta-analysis in contrast to control group. However, in CYD-TDV and AvP TDV groups, the headache was significantly in contrast to controls RR=1.23 95%CI (1.06-1.43) and 18.45 95%CI (1.21-281.98) respectively. Seropositive conversion against serotype 1 was significantly higher in most of the vaccine groups in contrast to control. We expect to find safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of vaccines in the prevention of dengue virus infection, and effects on the severity of the disease as we complete the analysis of the study.

264,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Systemic review of outbreaks due to salmonella typhi and paratyphi in africa and asia; challenges and limitations,"Typhoid is a serious health issue, particularly in South Asia and in some regions of Africa. In addition to the high burden of endemic cases of the disease in these countries, outbreaks of typhoid pose a major challenge for the public health system. The recent outbreak of ceftriaxone resistant Salmonella Typhi in Pakistan led us to review the literature on typhoid outbreaks in Asia and regions of Africa to identify the case definitions, diagnostic criteria and methods used for outbreak control. We searched PubMed (1964-2018) for studies describing the outbreaks of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A and B in Asia and Africa. Articles on mathematical modeling, papers describing laboratory methods of the outbreak strain were also excluded. Out of a total 185 relevant articles, only 38 met the eligibility criteria.Of these, 10 outbreaks were reported from Africa and 28 from Asia. Reports from Africa were from 7 countries , 60% (6/10) were from south Africa, Zimbabwe and Uganda. The reports from Asia were from 14 countries of which 28%(8/28) were from India. More than 80% of the outbreaks were reported between 2000-2017. Varying case definitions and lab methods were used for the outbreaks. In Africa 80% of the reports used some form of lab investigation to confirm the cases, 25% used serology, 87% used a combination of blood culture and PCR. In Asia 82% used a lab method for case confirmation. Most (86%) used stool and blood cultures. The source of the outbreak was identified in 50% outbreaks in Africa of which 80% were due to contaminated food. In Asia 14% were due to contaminated food and 44%(12/27) due to contaminated water. In Africa 30% of studies took steps to control the outbreaks. In Asia 35%(11/28) took outbreak response measures, of which 45%(5/11) used WSH methods and 27% (3/11) used health education. Typhoid vaccination as control measure was used in only one outbreak in Africa and 2 in Asia. This review highlights the importance of developing standardized case definition, laboratory confirmation and guidelines for outbreak response to use in response to typhoid outbreaks as currently there are none provided by the WHO or CDC.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '10', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-10-01'}}","blood culture, conference abstract, health education, human, India, laboratory technique, Medline, polymerase chain reaction, practice guideline, serology, South Africa, systematic review, Uganda, vaccination, Zimbabwe","[{'ancestor': ['blood culture', 'blood examination', 'diagnostic procedure', 'hematological procedure', 'medical procedures', 'microbiological examination', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['education', 'health education', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['asia', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names', 'india', 'south asia']}, {'ancestor': ['laboratory technique', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['genetic procedures', 'nucleic acid amplification techniques', 'nucleic acid analysis', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['disease management', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'methodology', 'practice guideline', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['immunological procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'serology']}, {'ancestor': ['africa', 'africa south of the sahara', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names', 'south africa']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['africa', 'africa south of the sahara', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names', 'uganda']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['africa', 'africa south of the sahara', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names', 'zimbabwe']}]","[{'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Haq'}, {'initials': 'R.', 'surname': 'Yasin'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Khaliq'}, {'initials': 'T.', 'surname': 'Yousufzai'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Momin Kazi'}, {'initials': 'F.N.', 'surname': 'Qamar'}]",Pakistan,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

287,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Human papillomavirus prevalence among women following HPV vaccine introduction: A systematic review,"Background: Worldwide efforts have been made by some countries to offer HPV vaccination since its introduction in 2006. Population effectiveness of HPV vaccines is presently an active area of research. We review available evidence on the effectiveness of HPV vaccine uptake among young women to prevent HPV infection. Methods: A comprehensive search of published and grey literature was conducted in a number of electronic databases using a pre-defined search strategy related to HPV prevalence following vaccination. Data were extracted onto a purpose-designed data extraction form, pooled in a meta-analysis and stratified by continent. Results: Of the 13 studies which met our inclusion criteria, 8332 women were vaccinated aged 12 to 34 years from across the world. The pooled HPV (comprising types 6, 11, 16 and 18) prevalence among young vaccinated women was 7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5% to 9%). The 13 studies were conducted across 3 continents: HPV prevalence for North America was 5% (95% CI: 3% to 7%); Europe, 14% (95% CI: 9% to 18%) and Australia 5% (95% CI: 3% to 8%). Of the studies which reported the effect of vaccination on other non-vaccine HPV type prevalence (known as cross protective types) HPV (31, 33, 45, 51 & 58), the overall pooled cross protective HPV prevalence was 9% (95% CI: 6% to 12%), by continent North America had 14% (95% CI: 12 to 17%), Europe 7% (95% CI: 6 to 8%) and Australia with 8% (95% CI: 5% to 11%). Conclusion: This study showed an HPV prevalence of 7% in women vaccinated against HPV types 6,11,16 and 18, which represents a substantial difference to the 22% HPV prevalence in non-vaccinated women. There is however, still a dearth of information on vaccinated women and HPV prevalence, highlighting the need for further studies in this area.",Sexually Transmitted Diseases,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '09', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-09-01'}}","adolescent, adult, Australia, child, conference abstract, data extraction, drug therapy, Europe, female, human, human experiment, Human papillomavirus type 31, male, meta analysis, nonhuman, North America, prevalence, systematic review, vaccination","[{'ancestor': ['adolescent', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex', 'juvenile']}, {'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['australia', 'australia and new zealand', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['child', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex', 'juvenile']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['data extraction', 'data processing', 'information', 'information processing', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['drug therapy', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['experiment', 'experimentation', 'human experiment', 'in vivo study', 'investigative procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['alphapapillomavirus', 'dna virus', 'double-stranded dna virus', 'human papillomavirus type 31', 'organisms', 'papillomaviridae', 'papovavirus', 'virus']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['geographic names', 'north america', 'western hemisphere']}, {'ancestor': ['chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mathematical parameters', 'mathematical phenomena', 'parameters', 'prevalence', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical concepts', 'statistical parameters']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}]","[{'initials': 'P.', 'surname': 'Muusha'}, {'initials': 'L.', 'surname': 'Abdullahi'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Engel'}]",South Africa,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

To provide a theoretical basis for the formulation and promotion of HPV vaccination program in China, we investigated the HPV vaccine requirement among Chinese population, such as the awareness and knowledge of HPV vaccine and to explore the acceptability by an evidence-based medicine analysis. Methods: The analysis of HPV vaccine requirement among Chinese population was conducted across two English electronic database and three Chinese electronic database: PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) to search HPV vaccine with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: The awareness rate of HPV vaccination was 15.95%, and knowledge rate was 17.55%. The meta-analysis identified the willingness rate of 67.25% among participants to HPV vaccination for themselves, compared with 60.32% was the main obstacles for vaccination for themselves. Safety and efficacy were the main reasons for unwillingness to vaccination for their daughters.

290,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,The role of therapeutic HPV vaccine in the management of vulval and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia: A systematic review,"Background and Aims: VIN is becoming an increasingly problematic disease especially in older women. Although spontaneous regression has been reported (1.2%) VIN/VaIN are considered premalignant conditions with a suggested progression rate greater than that of cervix cancer. Current treatments are inadequate with high recurrence rates therefore ongoing costs of care are high. As HPV DNA is found in over 80% of VIN/VAIN we wanted to review the literature regarding the role of HPV vaccination in the treatment of women with HPV related VIN/VAIN. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Our search included any type of study design using any form of HPV vaccine in the treatment of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of HPV related VIN and/or VAIN. We excluded studies of other anogenital disease, vulval/vaginal carcinoma and/or studies using vaccines as prophylaxis. The important clinical outcomes were lesion response to vaccination, symptom improvement, immune response and HPV clearance. Results: We identified 93 articles - only 7 studies (129 women) met our inclusion criteria. Immunocompromised patients were excluded. These studies were all uncontrolled case series published between 2000 - 2017. There were no RCTs identified, and as none of the studies had control groups a meta-analysis was not possible. Reduction in lesion size was reported by all 7 studies, symptom relief by only 4 studies, HPV clearance, histological regression, and immune response were reported by 6 studies. Follow up was short commonly from 6 months to 1 year. Conclusions: With the introduction of the HPV vaccine in a primary prevention setting we should see a reduction in the incidence of VIN/VAIN.

Prostate cancer is the first most diagnosed cancer of men in developed countries and the forth one in developing countries in terms of incidence rate. It is also the third incident cancer of men in Iran along with a prevalence of about 10,000 cases. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a severe stage of the disease with a number of newly discovered treatment options. These therapeutic alternatives including abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T, radiopharmaceuticals and bone-targeted therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab) along with docetaxel have made the decision making process complex and challenging for clinicians. In addition to the challenges of selecting the best-fit treatment, high costs of new pharmaceuticals and technologies necessitates the health policy-makers to develop practice guidelines in adaptation with local resources and limitations. The aim of this paper is to review the clinical guidelines for the management of CRPC. For better comprehension of guideline recommendations, the main clinical trials on new treatments were also identified. The efficacy and safety outcomes including but not limited to overall survival, progression free survival, quality of life and adverse effects were summarized.

390,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Efficacy of the canine lyme vaccine in North America: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Lyme disease is endemic to some parts of North America, and is an emerging disease in others. Although tick preventives are available, vaccination is an increasingly common though controversial method used in the prevention of canine Lyme infection; reported efficacies of canine Lyme vaccines are highly variable, ranging from 50% to 100%. The objective of our research was as follows: to determine the efficacy of vaccines for Borrelia burgdorferi in North American dogs by comparing vaccinated dogs to those not receiving the vaccine. We used a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this objective. Monovalent and multivalent vaccines were considered eligible interventions. Our main outcome of interest was the reduction of clinical illness following exposure to B. burgdorferi. Outcome data were extracted as a binary outcome for the following clinical signs (assessed separately): lameness, anorexia, pyrexia, depression, lymphadenopa-thy. Experimental and analytical observational studies were considered eligible for inclusion. In addition to grey literature searches, the following electronic databases were searched with no language restrictions: MEDLINE, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts. The last search was performed on November 29, 2016. Thirteen challenge trials and three observational studies were identified as eligible, and twelve challenge trials contained sufficient data to be included in our meta-analysis. A meta-analysis could not be performed for observational studies due to an insufficient number of studies. None of the challenge trials assessed lymphadenopathy, but for each of the remaining four clinical signs a separate random effects meta-analysis was performed. With the exception of anorexia, all summary odds ratios were less than the null value of 1. Overall, the findings of our meta-analysis suggest that North American Lyme vaccines reduce the odds of clinical illness in dogs following exposure to B. burgdorferi. However, these results should be interpreted with caution since a number of issues related to small sample size, study quality, and publication bias were identified. No experimental field trials were identified, highlighting a major gap in the literature on this topic. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes in field conditions.",Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '11', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-11-01'}}","clinical assessment, comparative effectiveness, conference abstract, controlled study, dog, drug efficacy, field study, grey literature, human, language, Medline, meta analysis, nonhuman, North America, observational study, publication bias, sample size, systematic review, Web of Science","[{'ancestor': ['clinical assessment', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evaluation and follow up', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['comparative effectiveness', 'comparative study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['controlled study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'bilateria', 'canidae', 'caniformia', 'canis', 'carnivora', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'dog', 'eukaryote', 'laurasiatheria', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug activity', 'drug efficacy', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['field study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['arts and illustration', 'biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'grey literature', 'humanities', 'literature', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'interpersonal communication', 'language', 'social behavior', 'speech and language', 'verbal behavior', 'verbal communication']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['geographic names', 'north america', 'western hemisphere']}, {'ancestor': ['observational study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'environment', 'industry', 'industry and industrial phenomena', 'information', 'mathematical phenomena', 'publication bias', 'publishing', 'reporting bias', 'society', 'society and environment', 'statistical concepts']}, {'ancestor': ['investigative procedures', 'mathematical parameters', 'methodology', 'parameters', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'sample size', 'sampling', 'statistical parameters', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment', 'web of science']}]","[{'initials': 'N.', 'surname': 'Vogt'}, {'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Sargeant'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'MacKinnon'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Versluis'}]",Canada,,Failed to resolve DOI 10.1002/jvim.15319.

391,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Reducing the burden of rheumatic heart disease: Prevalence of group a streptococcus EMM clusters in Africa suggests adequate coverage by 30-valent vaccine,"Introduction: Vaccine prevention of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections is considered by many to be the most promising long-term approach to the prevention of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). A 30-valent vaccine, based on 30 of the >220 GAS emm-types encoding the cell surface M-protein, is currently undergoing preclinical trials, Sanderson-Smith subsequently devised a classification system grouping emm-types into 48 emm clusters, suggesting a cross-protection framework, and potentially extending vaccine coverage to all or most GAS serotypes. Hypothesis: Considering GAS emm cluster classification, the 30-valent vaccine currently under development provides poor coverage across Africa, compared with the rest of the world. Methods: Based on methods from the guidelines offered by the Cochrane Collaboration, the systematic review approach was employed to obtain prevalent emm-types and clusters from published literature to determine the distribution of GAS emm clusters in Africa and worldwide. We conducted a comprehensive search across a number of databases. Applying a priori criteria for inclusion, we selected articles reporting on prevalence of GAS emm-types and emm clusters regardless of region. Emm-types were converted to emm clusters where necessary. Data were extracted onto purpose-designed forms, captured electronically and analysed using Stata software. Results: The final dataset included 51,621 isolates, representing 159 different emm-types recovered from 39 countries in seven regions worldwide, (97 studies: Europe, n=35; Asia-Pacific, n=27; Oceania, n=13, North America, n=10; Latin America, n=6; Africa, n=4; Arab states, n=2). Meta-analysis of the worldwide emm clusters revealed that most represented was E4 (18% of n=51,621 isolates) which is included in the putative vaccine. In Africa, which has amongst the highest RHD burden, the most prominent cluster was E6 (19% of n=860 isolates) which is also included in the vaccine. Emm Clusters not included in the vaccine were largely absent in isolates from Africa. Conclusion: It is evident that the suggested emm cluster cross-protection framework has potential for implementation in future vaccine efforts, thus ensuring GAS coverage in Africa.",Circulation,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '11', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-11-01'}}","Africa, Arab, Asia, conference abstract, cross protection, disease burden, drug therapy, Europe, human, meta analysis, North America, Pacific islands, practice guideline, prevalence, software, South and Central America, systematic review","[{'ancestor': ['africa', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['afro-asiatic people', 'arab', 'ethnic group', 'named groups of persons', 'population group', 'semitic people']}, {'ancestor': ['asia', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning organ systems', 'cross protection', 'immunity']}, {'ancestor': ['disease burden', 'epidemiological data', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['drug therapy', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['geographic names', 'north america', 'western hemisphere']}, {'ancestor': ['geographic names', 'oceanic regions', 'pacific islands', 'pacific ocean']}, {'ancestor': ['disease management', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'methodology', 'practice guideline', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mathematical parameters', 'mathematical phenomena', 'parameters', 'prevalence', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical concepts', 'statistical parameters']}, {'ancestor': ['data processing', 'information', 'information processing', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment', 'software']}, {'ancestor': ['geographic names', 'south and central america', 'western hemisphere']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}]","[{'initials': 'M.T.', 'surname': 'Salie'}, {'initials': 'H.', 'surname': 'Moloi'}, {'initials': 'B.', 'surname': 'Muhamed'}, {'initials': 'M.E.', 'surname': 'Engel'}]",,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

443,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Immunogenicity to botulinum neotoxins: Long term clinical relevance in aesthetic and therapeutic injections,"Without any doubt, Botulinum Toxin is an amazing molecule with diverse clinical effects since the 1970S. The clinical use of Botulinum Toxin Type A and Type B (BONT-A and BONTB) has revolutionized the practice of medicine over the past 30 years. The safety and effectiveness of injectable Botulinum Toxin have been well established in both aesthetic and medical indications. However to reach the desired endpoints and to maintain the efficacy, the frequency of injections is required. By increasing the numbers of patients without favorable therapeutic responses, a new concern has re-emerged on the immunoresistance and loss of effectiveness to treatment. Primary and secondary non-responses have been hypothesized to be associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the neurotoxins. Various factors for the production of neutralizing antibodies has been proposed, including the manufacturing process of Botulinum Toxin, the antigenic protein load, the total toxin dose, booster injections, prior vaccination and exposure to fake products on the market. The purpose of this work was to systematically assess published studies and perform an analysis to determine how significant it is clinical relevance of immunoresistance to Botulinum Neurotoxins. A literature search was done by searching Embase, Pubmed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Cochrane Library databases of clinical trials. The results of this systematic review will be discussed to provide clinicians an updated high level of evidence for clinical importance of immunogenicity to Botulinum toxin formulations.",Journal of Investigative Dermatology,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '05', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-05-01'}}","adult, Cinahl, clinical trial (topic), Cochrane Library, conference abstract, drug formulation, Embase, female, human, immunogenicity, injection, male, market, Medline, systematic review, treatment response, vaccination","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'cinahl', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical trial (topic)', 'methodology', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'cochrane library', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['drug formulation', 'pharmaceutics', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'embase', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['antigen function', 'antigenicity', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning organ systems', 'immunity', 'immunogenicity']}, {'ancestor': ['administration of drugs, food and chemicals', 'injection', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['commercial phenomena', 'market', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy', 'treatment response']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}]","[{'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Shiri'}, {'initials': 'Z.', 'surname': 'Shiri'}, {'initials': 'F.', 'surname': 'Bahrami'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Shiri'}, {'initials': 'G.', 'surname': 'Ebrahimi'}, {'initials': 'H.', 'surname': 'Shiri'}, {'initials': 'B.', 'surname': 'Shiri'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Bahrami'}]",Iran,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

447,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Influenza vaccination in diabetes mellitus: Exploring patient burden and strategies to increase uptake,"Background: Annually, influenza causes serious illness in 3-5 million people, with upward of 600,000 influenza-associated deaths, globally. People with diabetes are at increased risk of complications from influenza that lead to hospitalizations, including lack of glycemic control, pneumonia, hospitalization, and mortality. Influenza vaccination can lower risk of complications, and guidelines recommend it annually for patients with diabetes. Nevertheless, vaccination rates in these patients remain below the global target of 75%. Ob jectives: Focused reviews were undertaken to explore the benefits of influenza vaccination in the DM population and to determine characteristics of successful programs in DM and other high-risk populations. Vaccination strategies in higher uptake populations, such as healthcare workers (where vaccination was mandatory) and the elderly were also reviewed. Discussion: Meta-analysis showed that in unvaccinated DM patients, the rate of all-cause mortality was approximately 4% and all-cause hospitalization was 6%, with vaccination reducing the risk by 47% (95% CI, 25 to 62) and 52% (95% CI, 6 to 76), respectively. However, these outcomes do not adequately capture the direct burden of influenza. Noticeably absent from the literature are outcomes measuring direct burden on the patient, such as change in work productivity, diabetes-related complications, and incremental financial burden on the patient. Despite a potential overlap with other chronic conditions, such as cancer and HIV, where influenza vaccination is also recommended, vaccination rates in DM are equal or slightly higher than these other conditions. Factors leading to success in high uptake populations included good communication with the target population, vaccination policies and availability/accessibility of the vaccine. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that influenza vaccination is beneficial in the DM population and should be considered an important tool in diabetes self-management. More research could assess which patient characteristics promote increased flu vaccination uptake in DM and which patient intervention outreach programs increase influenza vaccination.",Value in Health,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '05', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-05-01'}}","aged, all cause mortality, cancer patient, conference abstract, controlled study, death, female, glycemic control, health care personnel, high risk population, hospitalization, human, Human immunodeficiency virus, influenza vaccination, male, meta analysis, nonhuman, practice guideline, productivity, self care","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'aged', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['all cause mortality', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mortality', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer patient', 'miscellaneous named groups', 'named groups of persons', 'patient']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['controlled study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['death', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'carbohydrate metabolism', 'glucose metabolism', 'glycemic control', 'homeostasis and regulation', 'metabolic regulation', 'metabolism', 'regulatory mechanism']}, {'ancestor': ['health care concepts', 'health care personnel', 'named groups by occupation', 'named groups of persons']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'classification', 'coding and classification', 'danger, risk, safety and related phenomena', 'ecological phenomena and functions', 'environment', 'high risk population', 'infraspecific rank', 'population', 'population and population related phenomena', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'risk', 'society', 'society and environment', 'taxonomic rank', 'taxonomy']}, {'ancestor': ['health care concepts', 'health care management', 'hospital management', 'hospitalization', 'management', 'organization and management', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['human immunodeficiency virus', 'lentivirus', 'organisms', 'primate lentivirus', 'retroviridae', 'reverse transcribing virus', 'single-stranded rna reverse transcribing virus', 'virus']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'influenza vaccination', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['disease management', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'methodology', 'practice guideline', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['occupation and occupation related phenomena', 'productivity', 'society', 'society and environment', 'work']}, {'ancestor': ['care and caring', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'self care', 'social aspects and related phenomena', 'society', 'society and environment']}]","[{'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Liska'}, {'initials': 'O.', 'surname': 'Banyon'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Samson'}, {'initials': 'C.', 'surname': 'Whittington'}, {'initials': 'E.', 'surname': 'Murray'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Beal'}]",France,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

448,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Dengue vaccine efficacy: A systematic review,"Objectives: This study aims to assess the efficacy of Dengue Vaccine. Methods: A systematic review with a meta-analysis was conducted using randomized controlled clinical trials published between 2000 and 2017 that were identified in the MEDLINE databases via PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane Library and EMBASE. The selection was performed by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. The meta-analysis using the random-effects model was performed. The bias risk assessment was independently performed by two reviewers (L.T.C.S. and B.T.) using the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess the risk of bias from clinical trials [9]. The following criteria were evaluated: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (masking of participants and professionals); detection bias (masking of outcome assessors); friction bias (incomplete outcomes or losses) and reporting bias (reporting of selective outcome). For other biases, we evaluated the conflict of interest. Results: Seven clinical trials were included, with a total of 66,511 participants between the ages of 2 and 45 years. The efficacy of the vaccine as estimated at 44%, with a range from 25% to 59% and high heterogeneity (I2= 80.1%). The serotype-stratified meta-analysis was homogeneous, except for serotype 2, with a heterogeneity of 65%. Regarding the immunogenicity, most of the vaccinated individuals were previously immune to at least one serotype, with seropositivity varying in the studies from 37% to 81%.], All studies presented a high bias risk for conflict of interest. Two papers presented a high risk of bias for the masking of participants and professionals. Conclusions: Compared with other commercially available vaccines, the dengue vaccine showed poor efficacy. Most of the vaccinated individuals had previous immunity for at least one serotype, which generated safety concerns in individuals without previous immunity. Vaccination may lead to an unwanted response in the mon-immune vaccinated subject, questioning the use for disease prevention.",Value in Health,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '05', 'day':

449,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Global burden of seasonal influenza disease: A structured literature review,"Objectives: To review published data on the global burden of seasonal influenza in terms of epidemiology, economics, and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: The overall incidence of seasonal influenza was estimated from the incidence rates of infected cases in the placebo groups of clinical trials on vaccines and prophylactic antivirals identified in systematic literature reviews. Targeted searches were performed on Medline to assess: the overall economic burden of influenza from observational studies, HRQoL associated with influenza and excess mortality/hospitalization rates during influenza outbreaks based on statistical regression analyses. Geographical scope covered the US, EU5 and Japan. Results: Average incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated between 3.71% in adults and 35.39% in children over 6 and up to 16 years old (yo). Large variability, related to different factors including season, country and target population, was observed between studies. The incidence rate of hospitalization appeared relatively high in < 5 yo children, declined in 5-17 yo children and increased progressively after 18 yo. Patients aged > 65 yo had the highest mortality rates. Type A influenza caused more hospitalizations and deaths than type B. Influenza resulted in a significant economic burden, including office visits, laboratory tests, emergency department visits, hospital stays with possible ICU admission, and medications. Major cost components were the productivity costs (absenteeism of infected adults or parents of infected children), the physician visit costs and the hospitalization costs related to influenza or its complications. Although the HRQoL impact of influenza on the infected population is often highlighted in evaluations of influenza vaccines and treatments, data on the HRQoL impact of influenza are scarce. Conclusions: Despite efforts to vaccinate high-risk individuals, influenza remains associated with a substantial public health and economic burden in developed countries, mostly related to complications in high-risk patients, and absenteeism in otherwise healthy patients.",Value in Health,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '05', 'day': '01', 'content':

450,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine in pregnancy and impact on pregnancy outcome,"Objectives: Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of HBV vaccination in pregnancy to reduce risk of transmission, but the risk/benefit of HBV vaccination in pregnancy has not been fully elucidated due to limited data on pregnancy outcomes. This study evaluated data on HBV vaccination in pregnancy and impact on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: MEDLINE was searched in Jan 2018 using the search terms: hepatitis B vaccine, pregnancy, major congenital malformations (MCMs), preterm birth, spontaneous abortion (SAB), and fetal/neonatal death. The search identified 1 RCT, 5 prospective cohort studies, and 1 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) study; 5 of 7 studies were conducted in the 1980's-90's. Results: The RCT and 2 cohort studies examined recombinant HBV vaccines in 284 pregnant women. Vaccination occurred in the 1st trimester in the cohort studies and 3rd trimester in the RCT. No MCMs and 1 SAB were reported. The preterm birth rate was comparable to general population rates. The other 3 cohort studies examined plasma-derived HBV vaccines in 97 pregnant women. Vaccination occurred in the 1st trimester in 1 study and 2nd/3rd trimester in the other 2. No MCMs, SABs, or preterm births were reported. The stillbirth rate was comparable to the comparator (1.4 vs 1.2). The VAERS study included 192 pregnant women receiving HBV vaccines from 1990-2015. Most were vaccinated in the 1st trimester and 110 adverse events were reported, including the following pregnancy-related events: 5 unique MCMs, 23 SABs, 1 neonatal death, 2 stillbirths, and 7 preterm births. Conclusions: The majority of prospective studies identified are old, have limited sample sizes, and inappropriate exposure windows.

451,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,"The comparative efficacy, safety, and reactogenicity, of herpes zoster vaccines: A network meta-analysis","Objectives: To estimate the relative efficacy, safety, and reactogenicity of vaccines for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) using network meta-analysis (NMA) based on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Methods: A systematic literature review evaluated two different HZ vaccines: HZ adjuvanted subunit (HZ/su) and Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL), with different formulations assessed. Detailed feasibility assessment indicated that a NMA was feasible for efficacy (against HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)), safety (serious adverse events), and reactogenicity (injectionsite reactions, systemic reaction) outcomes. Primary analyses included frequentist NMAs with fixed effects for efficacy outcomes, due to limited data availability, and both fixed and random effects for safety and reactogenicity outcomes. As age is a known effect modifier of vaccine efficacy (VE), VE analyses were stratified by age. Results: HZ/su demonstrated significantly higher HZ efficacy than ZVL in adults É?æ 60 years of age (YOA) (VEHZ/su= 0.92 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.88, 0.94), VEZVL= 0.51 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.57)) and adults É?æ 70 YOA (VEHZ/su= 0.91 (95%CI: 0.87, 0.94), VEZVL= 0.37 (95%CI: 0.25, 0.48)). Similarly, HZ/su demonstrated significantly higher PHN efficacy than ZVL in adults É?æ 60 YOA (VEHZ/su= 0.89 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.96), VEZVL= 0.66 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.78)) and adults É?æ 70 YOA (VEHZ/su= 0.89 (95%CI: 0.69, 0.96), VEZVL= 0.67 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.80). The 95%CIs of the differences of VEHZ/su and VEZVL estimates did not contain 0, indicating that these were statistically significant. HZ/su was associated with significantly more injection-site and systemic reactions compared to most formulations of ZVL and placebo, however definitions and data collection procedures differed. There were no statistically significant differences found between HZ/su and any formulation of ZVL or placebo for serious adverse events. Conclusions: HZ/su is significantly more effective in reducing HZ and PHN incidence in adults É?æ 60 YOA when compared to ZVL. As anticipated with an adjuvanted vaccine, HZ/su results in more reactogenicity following immunization, but no safety differences were found between HZ/su and ZVL.",Value in Health,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '05', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-05-01'}}","adult, comparative effectiveness, conference abstract, drug efficacy, drug formulation, drug safety, drug therapy, feasibility study, female, human, immunization, incidence, injection site, male, meta analysis, network meta-analysis, pharmacokinetics, prevention, randomized controlled trial (topic), systematic review","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['comparative effectiveness', 'comparative study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug activity', 'drug efficacy', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['drug formulation', 'pharmaceutics', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug safety', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['drug therapy', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['feasibility study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'incidence', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['administration of drugs, food and chemicals', 'injection', 'injection site', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'network meta-analysis', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical trial (topic)', 'controlled clinical trial (topic)', 'methodology', 'randomized controlled trial (topic)', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}]","[{'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'McGirr'}, {'initials': 'R.', 'surname': 'Widenmaier'}, {'initials': 'D.', 'surname': 'Curran'}, {'initials': 'E.', 'surname': 'Espie'}, {'initials': 'T.', 'surname': 'Mrkvan'}, {'initials': 'L.', 'surname': 'Oostvogels'}, {'initials': 'B.', 'surname': 'Simone'}, {'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'McElhaney'}, {'initials': 'K.', 'surname': 'Haeussler'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Thano'}, {'initials': 'R.', 'surname': 'Newson'}]",Canada,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

By far, HPV vaccination is widely used for risk reduction; however, the rate of developing cervical cancer post-vaccination is still not well-studied. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between HPV vaccination and development of cervical cancer in Southeast Asia. Analysis of data on HPV vaccination in Southeast Asia was performed, based on literature from 2010 to 2016 accessible in PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Vaccination coverage rates and changes in cervical cancer incidence in particular countries were subjected to comparative analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The statistical analysis showed HPV vaccination coverage and cervical cancer incidence has negative correlation but not significant (r=- 0.04, p>0.05). This might due to HPV vaccination introduction is still at early stage (<10 years of implementation). In addition, 5 out of 9 countries are running the vaccination program as pilot project rather than nationwide program. Other factors may also influence the incidence of cervical cancer such as: genetics and lifestyle factor, socioeconomic status as well as having many children. Nevertheless, follow up study is needed to assess effect of HPV vaccination introduction and coverage to cervical cancer incidences in Southeast Asian countries.",Hiroshima Journal of Medical Sciences,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '05', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-05-01'}}","article, cancer incidence, cancer risk, female, genetics, human, lifestyle, meta analysis, social status, Southeast Asia, Southeast Asian, vaccination, vaccination coverage","[{'ancestor': ['article', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer incidence', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'incidence', 'medical parameters', 'oncological parameters', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer risk', 'danger, risk, safety and related phenomena', 'diseases', 'environment', 'general aspects of disease', 'hazard', 'health hazard', 'medical parameters', 'oncological parameters', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['biology', 'biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'genetics', 'natural science']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'lifestyle', 'lifestyle and related phenomena', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['social aspects and related phenomena', 'social status', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['asia', 'eastern hemisphere', 'far east', 'geographic names', 'southeast asia']}, {'ancestor': ['asian', 'citizen group', 'named groups of persons', 'population group', 'southeast asian']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination coverage']}]","[{'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Lestari'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Kuno'}, {'initials': 'G.', 'surname': 'Facicilia'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Aisyah'}, {'initials': 'R.A.', 'surname': 'Kemal'}, {'initials': 'I.', 'surname': 'Agusta'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Sumarpo'}]",Indonesia,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

480,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Immunomodulation in novel cancer therapies: The role of CC-motif chemokine ligand 21 and programmed cell Death Protein 1,"Purpose/Objective(s): Investigations in immunomodulating therapies for cancer treatment over the past 20 years have flourished. Given the complex tumor microenvironment and differential signaling pathways, a wide variety of potential targeting mechanisms have come to attention. Herein, we review the immunomodulating potential of Chemokine 21 (CCL-21) in preclinical and clinical studies, as well as examine the novel multifaceted immune-based treatments in advanced head and neck cancer. Materials/Methods: A systematic review of the CC-motif Chemokine Ligand 21 in order to identify the inflammatory historical background, role in cancer, preclinical investigations, and novel polymer-based delivery system was undertaken. Additionally, current ongoing clinical trials were evaluated for impact. Finally, the role of CCL-21 in the head and neck cancer population is reviewed and future pathways discussed. Results: The role of CCL-21 is critical in promoting DC homing and Tlymphocyte activation. Tumor antigen presentation is significantly amplified both locally and peripherally following introduction of CCL- 21. The results of the phase 1 studies in lung cancer and melanoma are promising. CCL21 is important in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures and their presence in tumors is associated with favorable immune responses. Conclusion: Based on the findings on CCL21, it is anticipated that the rational combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy will improve the antitumor benefit of this chemokine in a broad range of solid tumors with low tumor infiltrating lymphocyte frequency (TIL). Future studies could assess the combined efficacy of CCL21-based regimens with immune checkpoint blockade therapy in various solid tumors as immune activation by CCL21 leads to upregulation of PD-1 on activated T cells. CCL21-based therapeutic vaccination approaches will prove beneficial for tumors that are not accessible for intratumoral administration of CCL21. Furthermore, material and nanoparticle engineering provides several attractive strategies to design more potent CCL21 immunotherapy.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology

483,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Blood group a predicts enterotoxigenic escherichia coli severity,"Objectives Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a predominant diarrheagenic E. coli pathovar responsible a substantial burden of acute diarrheal illness, deaths, and postdiarrheal sequelae including malnutrition, growth delays, and impaired cognitive development. Clinically, ETEC diarrheal illness ranges from mild to severe cholera-like disease. ETEC express heat-stabile toxin (ST) or heat-labile toxin (LT), or both. LT is an AB5 toxin closely related to cholera toxin. While epidemiological surveys have highlighted an association between individuals with blood group O and severe cholera, there is no apparent increase in ETEC disease severity linked to blood group O. Interestingly, our recent studies of ETEC pathogenesis led to the finding that a secreted adhesin specific to ETEC, EtpA, binds preferentially to blood group A (BgA) glycans. These interactions govern the effective delivery of both LT and ST to target epithelial receptors thereby contributing to disease severity. The study goal is to advance our understanding of the relationship between EtpA, disease severity, and blood type. Methods A variety of molecular methods were using to confirm an interaction between EtpA and BgA sugars. We screened against an array of more than 400 glycans, and confirmed the interactions with biolayer interferometry and hemagglutination. Next we generated a CRISPR-derived mutant of BgA expressing HT-29 carcinoma cells to produce only blood group O sugars which were again used to confirm the BgA-EtpA interaction. To advance our findings, were propagated intestinal stem cell derived enteroids as polarized monolayers from individuals with Blood Group A, B, or O. Finally, we obtained a convenience sample of 106 volunteers in controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies of ETEC diarrhea who served as vaccine placebo controls in prior studies. Blood type was determined in a blinded fashion and a meta-analysis was performed to determine the association between blood type and diarrheal severity. Results Our glycan array containing more than 400 human glycans demonstrated that EtpA binds specifically to BgA sugars which were confirmed using biolayer interferometry whereby EtpA bound to BgA but not group B or O sugars. Only BgA red blood cells agglutinated in the presence of EtpA. Using the CRISPR-derived mutant of HT29 cells, EtpA binding was disrupted in the mutant line (blood group O) as was adhesion of the EtpA-expressing H10407 ETEC strain. Moreover these in vitro studies demonstrated that both EtpA and blood group A expression were essential for effective delivery of both toxins. We next confirmed these findings in polarized enteroid monolayers derived from human intestinal stem cells. Using enteroid lines from individuals with blood groups A, B, or O we demonstrated preferential binding of EtpA, as well as enhanced EtpA dependent bacterial adhesion and toxin delivery to blood group A cells. These findings prompted an examination of the relationship of blood group and disease severity using samples obtained from four prior ETEC CHIM studies in which 106 volunteers were challenged with the EtpA-expressing H10407 strain. A meta-analysis demonstrated that blood group A or AB volunteers were more likely to develop moderate or severe diarrhea (MSD) relative to blood group O and B volunteers (odds ratio=1.44, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.90). Overall, 81% (95% CI: 66 to 97%, N= 24) of BgA patients developed MSD while for group O, 56% (44-69%, n=64) and B, 53% (25-82%, n=15) developed MSD. Age and race were not associated with MSD. Conclusions Collectively our results provide additional insight into the molecular pathogenesis of these common pathogens. EtpA appears to be the sole BgA binding lectin expressed by ETEC and is likely to be responsible for the increased disease severity in BgA volunteers. These findings have significant implications for design and interpretation of future ETEC CHIM studies and can inform the rational design of vaccines to protect individuals at risk for the most severe cholera-like presentation of these infections.",Journal of Investigative Medicine,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '04', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-04-01'}}","adult, bacterium adherence,

488,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with diabetes: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Globally, diabetes is one of the leading causes of death annually. Influenza vaccination has been shown effective in preventing complications in diabetic patients, however many patients with diabetes still remain unvaccinated. OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients of any age to understand the impact on patients health. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using two electronic databases (PubMed and Embase) on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in diabetic patients. RESULTS: Among 1,649 search results, 12 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for our review. All-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization rates were the measures of influenzavaccine effectiveness. All studies presented data on > 18 year old type 1 & type 2 diabetes patients. All diagnostic data was extracted using ICD-9 & ICD-10 codes. Studies were conducted in various countries U.S. (2), UK (2), Belgium (1), Netherlands (1), Spain (1), Canada (1), Israel (1), Taiwan (2). Some studies were of short duration (1-3 years) and few analyzed longer data set (7-8 years). Studies conducted over a longer time period (> 2 yrs) captured variety of influenza strains in measuring vaccine effectiveness. Six studies reported an average range of 24% to 33% reduction in mortality rate and four studies reported a range from 28% to 54% reduction in hospitalization in vaccinated diabetic patients. Many studies exhibited bias (such as selection), missing age stratification and multiple vaccination confounding were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a steady increase in the level of evidence supporting the benefits of influenza vaccinations in diabetic patients. These benefits seem to outweigh the risk and hypothetical cost of not getting immunized. Although influenza vaccination is recommended, a lack of awareness, may still lead to less than desirable vaccination rates in diabetic patients. Our findings highlight the necessity for further research to assist in educating both patient and healthcare professionals on the benefits of influenza vaccination in the diabetic community.",Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '04', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-04-01'}}","adult, all cause mortality, awareness, Belgium, Canada, conference abstract, diabetic patient, Embase, female, hospitalization, human, ICD-10, ICD-9, influenza vaccination, Israel, male, Medline, mortality rate, Netherlands, Spain, stratification, systematic review, Taiwan","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['all cause mortality', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mortality', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['attention', 'awareness', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'cognition', 'mental function', 'psychophysiology']}, {'ancestor': ['belgium', 'eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names', 'western europe']}, {'ancestor': ['canada', 'geographic names', 'north america', 'western hemisphere']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['diabetic patient', 'miscellaneous named groups', 'named groups of persons', 'patient']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'embase', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['health care concepts', 'health care management', 'hospital management', 'hospitalization', 'management', 'organization and management', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['classification', 'coding and classification', 'controlled vocabulary', 'disease classification', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease', 'icd-10', 'international classification of diseases', 'medical terminology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['classification', 'coding and classification', 'controlled vocabulary', 'disease classification', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease', 'icd-9', 'international classification of diseases', 'medical terminology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'influenza vaccination', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['asia', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names', 'israel', 'middle east', 'western asia']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mortality', 'mortality rate', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names', 'netherlands', 'western europe']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names', 'southern europe', 'spain']}, {'ancestor': ['environment', 'society and environment', 'soil and soil related phenomena', 'stratification']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['asia', 'eastern hemisphere', 'far east', 'geographic names', 'taiwan']}]","[{'initials': 'O.', 'surname': 'Nowak'}, {'initials': 'B.', 'surname': 'Boronea'}, {'initials': 'T.', 'surname': 'John'}, {'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Shang'}, {'initials': 'H.', 'surname': 'Parihar'}]",United States,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to describe the state of the art about HPV vaccines for preventing oral cancer. The aspects of prevention and control of infection by administering vaccines and the diffusion of sexual education campaigns are discussed also. In recent years there has been a growing interest in HPV in dentistry, suggesting a role of such a family of viruses in the development of oral cancers as well as of the uterine cervix. Even if the mass media have increasingly faced the problem, causing frequent alarming among patients, the dentist therefore needs a complete and up-to-date knowledge of this infectious condition that is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted mucous membrane infections (eg genital, anal and oral).

However, the effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis in preventing leprosy in contacts of affected patients for optimal disease control remains unclear and a significant public health issue in developing countries such as India, Brazil, and Bangladesh. Electronic searches of Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and LILACS up to October 2017 were conducted to identify eligible studies. Reference lists of potentially eligible studies were reviewed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemoprophylaxis with placebo for the prevention of leprosy infection in contacts of affected patients. A pair of reviewers independently screened eligible articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The GRADE approach was used to rate overall certainty of the evidence. Six RCTs including 52,483 participants proved eligible. Results suggested a statistically significantly reduction in clinical leprosy in contacts both, up to two years (Risk Ratio 2 (RR) 0.32, 95% Confidential Interval (CI) 0.17, 0.62; p < 0.0007; I =70%, p=0.07; low-certainty evidence) and 2 from two to five years of follow-up (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29, 0.89; p=0.02; I =80%, p < 0.0005; low-certainty evidence) with the use of chemoprophylaxis in comparison to placebo.

544,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,The role of vaccines in the prophylaxis of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in adult patients: A systematic reviewl,"HYPOTHESIS / AIMS OF STUDY: With increasing concerns over the rise of antibiotic resistance, there has been great interest in developing non-antibiotic prophylactic strategies for recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs). There has been a rise in the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of both new and existing vaccines for UTI prophylaxisin recent years. Theaim of this systematic review was to evaluate all available evidence from RCTs on the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of vaccines for the prophylaxis of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in adults. STUDY DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a systematic literature search in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines in the CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), EMBASEand MEDLINE (PubMed∂©) databases from inception to 21 st October 2017. For the construction of the search strategy, the following descriptors and their respective synonyms were used: urinary tract infection, vaccination and the names of vaccines currently in use (Uro-Vaxom∂©, Uromune∂©, and Solco-Urovac∂©). Abstracts from conferences or clinical trial registries were not considered. No publication year restrictions were enforced. Only articles in the English language were included in the analysis. Two independent reviewers searched for and included randomized controlled trials that compared the prevention of uncomplicated UTIs in adult patients (É?æ18yrs) using vac-cines/immunostimulants (intervention group) with placebo or non-placebo controls (control group). Data extraction and quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers using a pre-designed data extraction form. The primary outcome measure was the mean frequency of UTI recurrences. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed as a secondary outcome. Risk of bias was performed using the Jadad scale. Due to heterogeneity in the outcome reporting between studies, a narrative review of the results for each study was performed. RESULTS: We identified 3153 records and included nine RCTs that met the eligibility criteria. Of these, five studied Uro-Vaxom∂©/OM-89 (sample size 955, median Jadad score 3) three studied Solco-Urovac∂© (sample size 220, median Jadad score 2) and one studied ExPEC4V (sample size 194, Jadad score 4). All studies evaluating Uro-Vaxom∂©/OM-89 demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of UTIs when compared with placebo. The largest study to date evaluating the medium-term therapeutic efficacy of Uro-Vaxom∂© over a 12-month follow-up demonstrated the mean rate of recurrence to be significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group (0.84 vs. 1.28; p=0.0026) (1). Solco-Urovac∂© was also able to significantly reduce UTI recurrence and prolonged the time to re-infection. However, in one study this was only achieved after a booster cycle of the vaccine was administered to the patients a few months after the primary immunisation (2). Interestingly, no significant reductions were observed in the mean number of UTIs caused by vaccine-specific serotypes in ExPEC4V-treated patients when compared with placebo. However, significantly fewer UTIs caused by E. coli of any serotype were reported in the treatment group compared with placebo (0.414 mean recurrences vs 0.610 mean recurrences per patient respectively; p=0.038) (3). All three immunostimulants had a good safety profile with no severe treatment-related AEs being reported. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: The current evidence suggests that there is therapeutic benefit in the use of Uro-Vaxom∂©, Solco-Urovac∂© and ExPEC4V as safe prophylactic agents against RUTIs in adult patients. However, the studies were heterogeneous with short-term follow-up periods. The findings of this systematic review were limited by the lack of high quality RCTs, inconsistent definitions of UTI, heterogeneous measures of outcome between studies, the limited number of studies evaluating each vaccine and the exclusion of potentially relevant studies due to the search criteria and methodology employed. CONCLUDING MESSAGE: The therapeutic benefits of vaccines for uncomplicated UTI prophylaxis seem promising but larger-scale, longer-term and higher-quality trials that use uniform outcomes and definitions are warranted to better compare alternatives and draw conclusions in future.",Neurourology and Urodynamics,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '07', 'day': '01', 'content':

548,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Defining secondary antibody deficiency after heart transplantation,"Post transplant severe hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as IgG< 400mg/dL) has been found to be a risk factor of bacterial, viral and fungal infection in solid organ transplantation according to single center, multicenter and metanalysis studies. In the present study we report on the concentrations of different specific antimicrobial antibodies in heart recipients that were found to have severe hypogammaglobulinemia after heart transplantation to further characterize secondary antibody deficiency in these patients as a potential indication of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. In a prospective single center follow-up study we evaluated in 131 heart recipients the kinetics of total IgG and of specific antibody concentrations at baseline (pre-transplant) and day 7 and 30 after transplantation. IgG was performed by nephelometry. Specific antibodies included: IgG, IgA and IgM anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide (whole 23 serotypes), IgG anti-CMV, IgG anti-HBs, IgG anti-tetanus toxoid, IgG antivaricella zoster, IgG anti-salmonella typhi and IgG anti-haemophilus influenzae type B antibodies. All specific antibodies were tested by ELISA tests. During follow-up, 17 (12.9%) patients developed severe IgG hypogammaglobulinemia at least in one study point after transplantation. These patients were found to have significantly lower concentrations of IgG anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies [at day 7, p=0.002, day 30, p=0.010], IgG anti-HBs [day 7, p=0.001], IgG anti-CMV [day 7, p=0.046], IgG anti-varicella zoster [day 7, p=0.042], as compared with patients without severe hypogammaglobuliemia. Severe hypogammaglobulinemia was a risk factor of severe infection (OR 6.20, 95% confidence interval 2.09-18.39, p=0.0010) and a risk factor of death (OR 4.86, 95% confidence interval 1.39-16.89, p=0.01). Secondary severe IgG hypogammaglobulinemia early after heart transplantation is associated with specific antibody deficiency that could further explain why these patients are at a higher risk of developing severe infections. The association of this secondary antibody deficiency status with higher rates of death is a rationale for considering the role of immune replacement therapy in this

Case reports of optic neuritis (ON) following vaccination can lead to distrust in the safety of vaccines, therefore it is important to gather existing knowledge on vaccines and ON in order not to confuse temporal and causal relations. Methods: This study is a literature review on the role of vaccines regarding the risk of developing ON. Results: A systematic literature review on the database PubMed. Conclusion: The summarised results of the studies did not raise sufficient evidence to back up a positive association between ON and vaccination against HBV, HAV, HPV, MMR, influenza, variola, varicella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, anthrax, meningococcal, pneumococcal or typhoid.

603,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Vaccines for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections: A systematic review,"Introduction & Objectives: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) pose a major burden of disease worldwide. High prevalence and recurrence rates, coupled with increasing antimicrobial resistance, have highlighted the need for a vaccine. We assessed current vaccine candidates primarily according to clinical efficacy in reducing UTI recurrence rate. Materials & Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and reference lists of relevant reviews were searched up to August 2017 for relevant English-titled citations. Randomised controlled trials were selected by two independent reviewers according to compliance with population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO) criteria; vaccine versus placebo for the reduction of UTI recurrence in adult patients experiencing recurrent UTIs. Differences in recurrence rates in study populations for individual trials were calculated and pooled, and risk ratios using random effects models were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-squared and I2 testing. Results: 598 records were identified, of which 10 studies including data for a total of 1668 patients were selected. 3 vaccine candidates were studied: Uro-Vaxom (6), Urovac (3), and ExPEC4V (1). Uro-Vaxom showed greatest reduction in UTI recurrence rate; the maximal effect was seen at 3 months compared with 6 months after initial treatment (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.57-0.78 and RR 0.78 95% CI 0.69-0.88). Urovac showed an effect at 20 weeks comparable to that of Uro-Vaxom at 3 months (RR 0.68 95% CI 0.56-0.83). ExPEC4V achieved reduction in E.coli UTI recurrence but this was not statistically significant (RR 0.75 95% CI 0.52-1.08) and was ineffective against UTIs caused by other uropathogens (RR 1.00 95% CI 0.55-1.80). Overall, UTI vaccines reduced recurrence compared to placebo (RR 0.72 95% CI 0.66-0.80), albeit substantial heterogeneity was Conclusions: While there is some evidence for the efficacy in vaccines in patients with recurrent UTIs, the significant heterogeneity amongst these studies renders interpretation and recommendation for routine clinical use difficult at present. Further randomized trials using consistent definitions and end-points are needed to study the long-term efficacy and safety of vaccines for preventing infections in patients with recurrent UTIs.

Theory suggests that low socio-economic (SES) groups are especially likely to benefit. Cue-automaticity describes how repetition of behaviour, initiated by a particular 'cue', in a constant context, leads to the automatic instigation and/or execution of behaviour. Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of cue-automaticity interventions to improve the uptake of adult preventive healthcare, and to consider how this might be applied to the design of interventions to promote preventive dental visiting.",Community dental health,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '03', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-03-01'}}","adult, association, dental procedure, health behavior, human, patient attitude, preventive health service, utilization","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['association', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'cognition', 'mental function', 'thinking']}, {'ancestor': ['dental procedure', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'health behavior']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['attitude', 'behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'human relation', 'patient attitude', 'social behavior']}, {'ancestor': ['care and caring', 'community care', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'preventive health service', 'social aspects and related phenomena', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['utilization']}]","[{'initials': 'H.', 'surname': 'Raison'}, {'initials': 'R.', 'surname': 'Corcoran'}, {'initials': 'R.V.', 'surname': 'Harris'}]",,,Failed to resolve DOI 10.1922/CDH_4174Raison10.

657,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Comparison of different rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin formulations in allogeneic stem cell transplantation: Systematic literature review and network meta-analysis,"Introduction Since 2000, phase III randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigated the efficacy of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG) in patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, comparisons of different ATG formulations do not exist. Our aim was to synthesize all efficacy evidence, enabling a comparison of all available formulations of rabbit ATG in the allo-SCT setting. Methods We performed a systematic literature review to identify all available phase III RCTs using EMBASE , MEDLINE , MEDLINE in-process, the Cochrane Library and the website www.clinical-trials.gov. In addition, meeting abstracts (ASH, ASCO, EHA) were screened to include the most up-to-date evidence. Studies were included if they described a phase III RCT among adult patients who received rabbit globulins in the allo-SCT setting and if they reported results of the following end points of interest: chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD, all grades), acute GVHD II-IV and III+IV, transplant-related mortality (TRM), overall survival (OS), incidence of relapse and CMV reactivation. The actual network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed by using a conventional Bayesian fixed-effect framework and hazard ratios (HR) for most end points while risk ratios (RR) were used for dichotomous outcomes. Analyses were done with the R package netmeta. The most common treatment, cyclosporine and methotrexate, was used as reference treatment. Results We identified six phase III RCTs comprising five full publications and one conference abstract between 2001 and 2016, which investigated the following treatment options: 1) Grafalon (Neovii Biotech, Graefelfing, Germany) consisting of polyclonal IgG obtained from hyperimmune sera of rabbits immunized with the human Jurkat leukemic T-cell line (ATLG), and 2) Thymoglobulin (Genzyme-Sanofi, Lyon, France), in which immunization was done with human thymocytes recovered from patients undergoing cardiac surgery (Thymo). The overall population comprised 871 patients (ATLG: n = 610, and Thymo: n = 261). Population per trial ranged from 27 to 126 patients in the ATG arm and from 25 to 128 patients in the non-ATG arm. The median age of patients ranged from 28 to 49 years. More patients were male, except in the ATG arm of one ATLG trial. To include all trials within one framework, we had to assume: 1) the relative efficacy of ATG versus cyclosporine and methotrexate was identical to that of tacrolimus and methotrexate, which was used as reference treatment in one ATLG trial; 2) no difference in efficacy due to different graft sources or conditioning regimens; 3) no difference in efficacy due to dosage scheme. Figure 1a-f presents the NMA results of the main end points with HRs/RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) versus standard treatment (cyclosporine and methotrexate). Only ATLG was significantly better than standard treatment in preventing GVHD with a HR of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.56) regarding chronic GVHD, and HRs of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.73) and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.86) regarding acute GVHD II-IV and III+IV. The risk of chronic, acute GVHD II-IV and III+IV was reduced by ATLG with 58%, 46% and 50% versus standard treatment. Both ATLG and Thymo were at least similarly effective versus standard treatment and showed no difference in relative efficacy regarding TRM with HRs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.32) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.56 to 1.44). Considering OS, incidence of relapse and CMV reactivation, the NMA yielded at least similar results of both formulations versus standard treatment, with Thymo tending to be better regarding OS with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.26) while resulting less clearly in better relative efficacy regarding relapse with a HR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.24) and CMV reactivation with a RR of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.16). Conclusions Our NMA compared all available rabbit ATG formulations and identified ATLG being the best option to prevent chronic and acute GVHD. Both formulations show similar efficacy in TRM while Thymo tends to be better regarding OS. Since randomized head-to-head comparisons are missing, this NMA provides a complete overview of each formulation's relative efficacy.

661,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Prevalence of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection in Chinese children: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Haemophilus influenzae type b is an important cause of invasive bacterial disease in children worldwide. The establishment of epidemiological estimates is an essential first step towards the introduction of H influenzae type b vaccine into the Chinese national immunisation programme. We therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of H influenzae type b in Chinese children. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and Ovid databases for studies published up to Dec 31, 2016, that reported the prevalence of H influenzae type b among children in mainland China. We used random-effects meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence of H influenzae type b in healthy children and in those with acute lower respiratory tract infection or bacterial meningitis. Findings 27 studies met prespecified inclusion criteria, and these included 15 783 children in 14 provinces. The pooled prevalence of H influenzae type b in healthy children, children with acute lower respiratory tract infection, and bacterial meningitis was 5.87% (95% CI 3.42-8.33), 4.06% (3.29-4.83), and 27.32% (0.41-54.24), respectively. Metaregression showed that the prevalence of H influenzae type b in healthy children remained stable after the introduction of H influenzae type b vaccine in 1997 (p=0.725), whereas the proportion of children with acute lower respiratory tract infection due to H influenzae type b showed a decreasing trend (P<0.0001) and was higher in northern China than in the south (p<0.0001). Significant heterogeneity was noted across and within regions (P<0.0001). Differences in sex, age groups, and study sample size did not explain the heterogeneity. Interpretation H influenzae type b is a common pathogen in healthy children and an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection and bacterial meningitis in China. Introduction of H influenzae type b vaccine into the Chinese national immunisation programme could reduce the burden of H influenzae type b disease in China.",The Lancet,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '12', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-12-01'}}","China, conference abstract, controlled study, female, groups by age, Haemophilus influenzae type b, human, male, Medline, meta analysis, nonhuman, prevalence, preventive health service, sample size, systematic review, Web of Science","[{'ancestor': ['asia', 'china', 'eastern hemisphere', 'far east', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['controlled study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['bacterium', 'gammaproteobacteria', 'gram negative bacterium', 'gram negative facultatively anaerobic rods', 'haemophilus', 'haemophilus influenzae', 'haemophilus influenzae type b', 'organism forms', 'organisms', 'organisms by outer appearance', 'pasteurellaceae', 'pasteurellales', 'prokaryotes by outer appearance', 'proteobacteria']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'mathematical parameters', 'mathematical phenomena', 'parameters', 'prevalence', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical concepts', 'statistical parameters']}, {'ancestor': ['care and caring', 'community care', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'preventive health service', 'social aspects and related phenomena', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['investigative procedures', 'mathematical parameters', 'methodology', 'parameters', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'sample size', 'sampling', 'statistical parameters', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment', 'web of science']}]","[{'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Yang'}, {'initials': 'W.', 'surname': 'Cheng'}, {'initials': 'X.', 'surname': 'Pan'}, {'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Yang'}, {'initials': 'R.W.', 'surname': 'Scherpbier'}, {'initials': 'X.', 'surname': 'Zhu'}, {'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Zhou'}, {'initials': 'Q.', 'surname': 'Jiang'}]",China,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

662,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,"A review on construction of pcDNA 3.1+ with cloning RpfB, RpfD, and RpfE genes of mycobacterium tuberculosis as DNA vaccine","OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) remains as a major cause of death in the world. One strategy to reduce TB prevalences is the vaccination. Nevertheless, available currently vaccine is only BCG vaccine that is known to have the power of protection not more than 100 % and different for each country. The research of TB vaccine, especially vaccines that easily manufactured is a challenge for TB free by 2050. Designing and construction of a new vaccine against TB is an effective effort to reduce TB cases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains five resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) homologues, RpfA-E. In this review article, several relevant studies have been included. This study corcern at design and construction a DNA vaccine by cloning the RpfB, RpfD, and RpfE genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in to plasmid pcDNA 3.1+ plasmid with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) then PCR amplification products were purified by several different methods. METHODS: The method used in the writing of this paper is the Cochrane Collaboration Review that includes literature studies, testing the quality of the study, the characteristics of the data collection, analysis, interpretation of results, and clinical trials as well as recommendations for further research. RESULTS: The several respective results were analyzed and interpreted which type of Rpf homologues and its construction design that is the most effective and potential as TB vaccine candidate. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data seem to point to an in vivo role of rpfB in mycobacterial replication rather than to a direct role in reactivation. In a rabbit model of Mtb infection, RpfB is preferentially expressed in dexamethasone treated rabbits versus latently infected animals.",American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '12', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-12-01'}}","conference abstract, controlled clinical trial, controlled study, human, in vivo study, information processing, nonhuman, plasmid, polymerase chain reaction, rabbit model, resuscitation, writing","[{'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical study', 'clinical trial', 'controlled clinical trial', 'controlled study', 'in vivo study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['controlled study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['in vivo study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['data processing', 'information', 'information processing', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['bacterial genetic phenomena and functions', 'bacterial phenomena and functions', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'biopolymer structure', 'cellular, subcellular and molecular biological phenomena and functions', 'chemical phenomena', 'chemical structure', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'microbiological phenomena and functions', 'mobile genetic element', 'molecular genetic phenomena and functions', 'nucleic acid structure', 'nucleic acid structure, metabolism and function', 'plasmid']}, {'ancestor': ['genetic procedures', 'nucleic acid amplification techniques', 'nucleic acid analysis', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'animal model', 'bilateria', 'biological model', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'experimental animal', 'experimental organism', 'experimental rabbit', 'glires', 'lagomorph', 'leporidae', 'mammal', 'model', 'opisthokonta', 'organism forms', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'rabbit model', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['emergency treatment', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'hospital care', 'intensive care', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'resuscitation', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'cognition', 'interpersonal communication', 'language ability', 'mental function', 'mental performance', 'motor activity', 'physical activity', 'physical activity, capacity and performance', 'psychomotor activity', 'social behavior', 'verbal behavior', 'verbal communication', 'writing', 'written communication']}]","[{'initials': 'D.', 'surname': 'Dermawan'}]",Indonesia,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

681,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,"Zika virus: A systematic review and meta-analysis in epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes","Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was recently declared as a global public health emergency due to its spreading around the world and its association with serious congenital malformations and neurological disorders. We aim to report the total Zika infected cases and the geographic distribution of those cases. We also intend to provide a thorough description of the epidemiological characteristics, signs and symptoms, biomarkers, outcomes, complications and route of transmission of Zika virus. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature, and meta-analyzed data that were sufficiently comparable. Data was obtained through an electronic search in 8 main databases, and the references lists of all included articles were also searched for relevant articles. Overall, this review included 258 articles. Most included articles were case reports and cross sectional studies, written in English language, and published between 2015 and 2016. The total number of confirmed, suspected, and probable cases of Zika virus infection was 54663. Confirmed cases span over 79 countries, with the highest frequency being in the region of the Americas. Excluding neonates with microcephaly, most patients were females and had a mean age of 35.8 years. Most common method of transmission was by mosquitoes, followed by sexual contact and blood transfusion. While most common clinical symptoms included skin rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and headache, conjunctivitis and the most common lab abnormalities were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The medical literature reported 1018 cases of microcephaly, 288 Guillain- Barr«∏ Syndrome, and only one case of encephalitis in association with Zika virus infection. Death occurred in 17 cases with Zika virus infection, with a mean age of 50.5 years, and most of them had underlying diseases. Due to its serious complications, and since no cure or vaccine are available, Zika virus remains an important threat to the public health that necessitates a wide cooperation on a global scale in developing prevention and managing strategies.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '11', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-11-01'}}","adult, blood transfusion, conference abstract, cross-sectional study, death, English (language), female, geographic distribution, human, medical literature, mosquito, newborn, nonhuman, public health, systematic review, Western Hemisphere","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', 'blood transfusion', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy', 'transfusion']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['cross-sectional study', 'diseases', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'methodology', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['death', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'english (language)', 'interpersonal communication', 'language', 'lingua franca', 'social behavior', 'speech and language', 'verbal behavior', 'verbal communication']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'geographic distribution', 'geography', 'medical geography', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['arts and illustration', 'biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'humanities', 'information', 'literature', 'medical literature', 'scientific literature', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['animal', 'animals by outer appearance', 'antliophora', 'arthropod', 'bilateria', 'culicomorpha', 'dicondylia', 'diptera', 'ecdysozoa', 'eukaryote', 'hexapod', 'holometabola', 'insect', 'invertebrate', 'mandibulate', 'mosquito', 'nematocera', 'neoptera', 'opisthokonta', 'organism forms', 'organisms', 'organisms by outer appearance', 'protostomia', 'tetraconata', 'winged insect']}, {'ancestor': ['child', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex', 'infant', 'juvenile', 'newborn']}, {'ancestor': ['human versus nonhuman data', 'nonhuman', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'biomedicine', 'medicine', 'public health', 'social medicine']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['geographic names', 'western hemisphere']}]","[{'initials': 'H.', 'surname': 'Giang'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Ghozy'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Elabd'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Sassy'}, {'initials': 'H.', 'surname': 'Elhadad'}, {'initials': 'D.', 'surname': 'Nguyen'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Hassan'}, {'initials': 'E.', 'surname': 'AbdElsalam'}, {'initials': 'L.', 'surname': 'Linh'}, {'initials': 'T.', 'surname': 'Anh'}, {'initials': 'T.', 'surname': 'Turk'}, {'initials': 'O.', 'surname': 'Onyeudo'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Nasef'}, {'initials': 'N.', 'surname': 'Dang'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Aly'}, {'initials': 'K.', 'surname': 'Hirayama'}, {'initials': 'N.', 'surname': 'Huy'}]",Viet Nam,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

682,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Strategies to improve coverage of communitybased distribution programs: A systematic review of the literature,"Community-based public health services aim to provide public health interventions at scale. However, many of these programs, including those targeting soil-transmitted helminths (STH), vitamin A supplementation, and child immunization, often fail to achieve World Health Organization (WHO) coverage targets. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify successful interventions to increase coverage of community-based distribution and to quantify the magnitude of observed change in coverage associated with each strategy. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and CAB Direct for studies that compared coverage estimates of community-based distribution of drugs, vaccines, or other public health services in the presence and absence of an intervention intended to increase distribution coverage. We identified 2,561 studies from which 119 full text articles were evaluated for possible inclusion. After review, twelve studies describing 14 interventions met inclusion criteria. Data abstracted from articles included location and design of study, strategy used to increase coverage, baseline coverage, and coverage obtained with the intervention. Local Ministries of Health funded eight of the interventions described, while six interventions were implemented using supplemental donor funding. Strategies identified to increase coverage included community involvement in the design and implementation of distribution (n=3, range of reported differences in coverage: +9%, +23%), increased distribution of health education and awareness materials (n=5, range: -4%, +26%), distributor incentives (n=1, +20%), converting from school- to community-based distribution (n=2, range: -2%, +82%), management by a non-governmental organization (n=1, +9%), and integrated distribution through Child Health Days (CHDs) (n=2, range: -31%, +72%). Several specific interventions to improve coverage of community-based public health service distribution have demonstrated impact. These results may be useful in the design of future community-based public health intervention programs.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '11', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-11-01'}}","adult, awareness, child health, conference abstract, Embase, female, funding, health education, human, human experiment, male, Medline, pharmacokinetics, public health service, systematic review","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['attention', 'awareness', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'cognition', 'mental function', 'psychophysiology']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'child health', 'health', 'physical constitution and health']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'embase', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['economic aspect', 'financial management', 'funding', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['education', 'health education', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['experiment', 'experimentation', 'human experiment', 'in vivo study', 'investigative procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['health care concepts', 'health care facilities and services', 'health care organization', 'health service', 'public health service']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}]","[{'initials': 'K.V.', 'surname': 'Deardorff'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Rubin-Means'}, {'initials': 'K.H.', 'surname': '«Åsbj«Ùrnsd«¸ttir'}, {'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Walson'}]",United States,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

683,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Thirteen globally conducted pre-clinical studies on dna vaccines against leptospira: A systematic review,"DNA vaccines have gained a novel place in prevention of bacterial infections. This study systematically reviews pre-clinical studies on DNA vaccines against Leptospira. All articles in English, regardless of the country of evaluation, were included from the following databases: PubMed, Trip, Google-Scholar, Science-Direct, Cochrane-Library, Google, Open-Grey and Grey-literature-report. Also, the reference lists of selected articles were screened for suitable studies. PRISMA 2009 guidelines were followed in conducting and reporting of this study results. Quality assessment of the selected studies was done using the SYRCEL's risk of bias tool for animal studies. Thirteen were included in the final analysis. The average quality assessment score was 6.7 (SD ∂Ò 1) out of 10. Thirty-nine percent (n=13) of the study was from Brazil, which was the highest. pTARGET plasmid (31%; n=13) and LipL32 (39%; n=13) were used as the commonest vector and target gene respectively. 31% (n=13) of the studies had Leptospira interrogans Copenhegani-Fiocruz-L1-130 as its main strain used in the construction of vaccine. The commonest expression system used was Prokaryotic-E.coli TOP 10 (31%; n=13). Golden Syrian hamster female and BALB/c mice were the commonest animal models used (39% each). Copenhegani Spool, Canicola Hond Utrecht and Pamona (Each 25% - 2/8) were the main strains used in challenging of DNA vaccine. Vector alone treatment (85%) was the commonest method among control groups. The humoral immune response was measured using ELISA in 85% of the studies. Hundred percent potential protective response and zero percent pathological events was seen with interventional DNA vaccines. Enhancement of the efficacy and safety of DNA vaccines against Leptospira relies on the finding of optimum vaccination schedule.

685,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Who is at risk of cholera in Africa? quantifying potential vaccine demand and impact policyrelevant spatial levels,"Africa is subject to high-mortality cholera epidemics and areas of persistent incidence. Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is becoming an important tool for cholera control as increased production has led to a growing interest in proactively vaccinating populations at high risk for infection. However, despite increases in OCV availability, the number of OCV doses available (É?¨10 million in 2017) is too low to conduct large, generalized campaigns in at-risk countries. To prioritize the use of current supplies and quantify future production needs it is important to identify populations living at high risk of cholera infection who would derive the most benefit from prophylactic OCV use. Using cholera incidence reports from 2010-2016 over multiple spatial scales, we map the incidence of cholera in 20x20 km grid scales throughout Africa. To provide risk estimates at a policy-relevant scale, we identify districts (2nd ISO administrative level) with a significant at-risk subpopulation that comprises either É?æ10% of a district's population or is É?æ100,000 people. Based on these criteria, 69.2 (95% CrI: 49.8- 89.2) million people live in high-risk districts in Africa based on an annual incidence threshold of É?æ1 per 1,000, and an additional 141.5 (95% CrI: 106.7-184.0) million people live in moderate-risk districts with incidence between 1 per 1,000 and 1 per 10,000. Assuming only direct vaccine protection at levels consistent with a recent meta-analysis, vaccinating everyone living in moderate- and high-risk areas could directly prevent more than 582,000 (95% CrI: 339,000-1,044,000) cases over a five-year period, but would require 421.5 (95% CrI: 313.0-546.4) million doses, more than 50x the global annual production of OCVs in 2016. However, if districts are sequentially prioritized by incidence rate, 50% of these cases could be prevented with only 12% of the OCV doses (50.7 million doses, 95% CrI: 49.0-54.2 million), and 95% could be prevented with only 51% of the required doses (214.5 million doses, 95% CrI: 205.1-232.6 million).",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '11', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-11-01'}}","Africa, conference abstract, human, incidence, risk assessment","[{'ancestor': ['africa', 'eastern hemisphere', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'epidemiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'incidence', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['danger, risk, safety and related phenomena', 'environment', 'risk', 'risk assessment', 'society and environment']}]","[{'initials': 'S.M.', 'surname': 'Moore'}, {'initials': 'A.S.', 'surname': 'Azman'}, {'initials': 'H.S.', 'surname': 'McKay'}, {'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Lessler'}]",United States,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

686,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,"Use of UK health services by Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers: Triangulation of two mixed methods studies","Background Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers (GRT) are less likely than the general population to access health services. The reasons are multiple, complex, and interlinked, and they exist at individual, provider, health system, and national levels. We report on two studies that explore GRT use of UK health services. Study 1 aimed to investigate barriers to, and facilitators of, immunisation, and identify interventions to promote uptake. Study 2 aimed to explore approaches that facilitate engagement and trust between GRT and health services, with maternity, early years, and child dental health services as exemplars. Methods Study 1, completed in 2016, involved in-depth interviews with 174 GRT from six communities and 39 service providers in Scotland and England, and intervention mapping and co-production workshops with 76 participants to prioritise interventions. Study 2, to be completed in 2017, involves systematic reviews and a realist synthesis; online consultation with 196 UK-based stakeholders; case studies involving interviews and focus groups with 44 GRT, 54 health-care professionals and 13 third sector staff in Scotland and England; and cross-sectoral workshops which will refine policy recommendations. Qualitative and quantitative analysis identified barriers and facilitators to receiving health care; and approaches to enhancing engagement and trust in health care. Ethics approval for study 1 was granted by National Research Ethics Service Committee Yorkshire and The Humber, Leeds East, and for study 2 by the NHS Health Research Authority East Midlands, Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee (16/EM/0028). Findings Barriers to health care included discrimination, economic disadvantage, differences in cultural interpretations, language, and health literacy. Facilitators included trust in health professionals and intergenerational change towards valuing health services. Approaches to enhancing engagement included specialist workers and named professionals for GRT communities, cultural training for professionals, and tailored or flexible systems. Facilitating the research depended on collaborating with trusted gatekeepers, and both studies used co-production methods to ensure that study recommendations are grounded in practice realities and acceptable to stakeholders. Interpretation The findings provide advice for practitioners and policy makers engaging with GRT people, as well as insight on supporting other marginalised populations. Exploring the experience of GRT, service provision, and policy offers a substantiated account enabling public health to reflect on success or otherwise of interventions aimed at tackling inequalities.",The Lancet,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '11', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-11-01'}}","adult, conference abstract, dental procedure, England, female, health literacy, human, human experiment, immunization, information processing, interview, language, male, medical research, physician, public health, quantitative analysis, research ethics, Romani (people), Scotland, staff, synthesis, systematic review, travel, trust, worker","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['dental procedure', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern hemisphere', 'england', 'europe', 'geographic names', 'great britain', 'united kingdom', 'western europe']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['economic aspect', 'education', 'educational status', 'health education', 'health literacy', 'social aspects and related phenomena', 'society', 'society and environment', 'socioeconomics']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['experiment', 'experimentation', 'human experiment', 'in vivo study', 'investigative procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['data processing', 'information', 'information processing', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['data collection method', 'interview', 'methodology', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'interpersonal communication', 'language', 'social behavior', 'speech and language', 'verbal behavior', 'verbal communication']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'medical research', 'research', 'science in general']}, {'ancestor': ['health care concepts', 'health care personnel', 'medical personnel', 'named groups by occupation', 'named groups of persons', 'physician']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'biomedicine', 'medicine', 'public health', 'social medicine']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'diagnostic procedure', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'quantitative analysis']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'ethics', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'humanities', 'philosophy', 'professional standard', 'research ethics', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['ethnic group', 'indo-aryan people', 'indo-european people', 'indo-iranian people', 'named groups of persons', 'population group', 'romani (people)']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names', 'great britain', 'scotland', 'united kingdom', 'western europe']}, {'ancestor': ['named groups by occupation', 'named groups of persons', 'staff']}, {'ancestor': ['chemical phenomena', 'chemical procedures', 'chemical reaction', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'synthesis']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['human activities', 'society', 'society and environment', 'travel']}, {'ancestor': ['behavior', 'biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'human relation', 'social behavior', 'trust']}, {'ancestor': ['named groups by occupation', 'named groups of persons', 'worker']}]","[{'initials': 'L.', 'surname': 'Siebelt'}, {'initials': 'C.', 'surname': 'Jackson'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'McFadden'}, {'initials': 'L.', 'surname': 'Dyson'}, {'initials': 'K.', 'surname': 'Atkin'}]",United Kingdom,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

704,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Efficacy of inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine (HantavaxÉ?Ω) in healthy adults through the eyes of metabolomics,"Efficacyofinactivated Hantaan virusvaccine (HantavaxÉ?Ω) has been questioned and controversial. This study was aimed to ensure vaccine effectiveness and the long-term immunogenicity of Hantavax@sup_beginTM@sup_endthrough high resolution metabolomics (HRM) using serum obtained from a phase III, multi-center, open-labelled clinical trial. A total of 19 subjects were administered with HantavaxÉ?Ω for 4 times with respective one month and 12 month intervals (0-1-2-13 schedule), including 2 primary and 2 booster doses. Based on antibody respace 5 people were high responders (HR), 8 were low responders (LR) and 6 were non responders (NR). Multivariate statistical analysis through heat map and OPLS-DA using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 showed a clear separation among the NR, LR and HR. Arginine, phenylalanine and tyrosine were found with the same intensity among all 19 subjects regardless of antibody response, which confirms the long term efficacy of vaccine. However, correlated to antibody response, cholesteryl nitrolinoleate, octanoyl-carnitine were significantly increased only among HR, while chenodeoxycholic acid, methyl palmitate were high among NR and LR but not HR.

718,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Malaria vaccines: A new weapon?,"Introduction: In Malaysia, a total of 2,302 malaria cases were reported in 2016. Plasmodium knowlesi malaria consisted of 69.5% of cases while 10.5% of cases were Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Malaria vaccine has been seen as one of the potential strategy in combating malaria endemic. However, RTS,S/AS01 is the only vaccine candidate reached phase 3 trial. The objective of this horizon scanning assessment is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and potential impacts of malaria vaccines. Methods: Malaria vaccines were identified proactively through horizon scanning activity; namely identification, filtration, prioritisation and assessment. Web pages (BBC News and Medtech Insight) and databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Google Scholar) were searched. Any relevant studies published in English until 14 March 2017 were reviewed. A literature review was conducted according to horizon scanning method. Results: A phase 3 of RTS,S/AS01 and a phase 1 field study of PfSPZ were reviewed. The RTS,S/AS01 study showed that vaccine efficacy (VE) against clinical malaria for Plasmodium falciparum were 36.35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31.8,40.5) in children and 25.9% (95%CI: 19.9,31.5) in infants who received primary and booster doses. The VE without booster dose was much lower in children (28.3% [95%CI: 23.3,32.9]) and infants (18.3% [95%CI: 11.7,24.4]). As for safety, meningitis cases were reported to be higher in vaccinated children than in control group (21 cases versus one case). In the field trial, PfSPZ gave 48.3% (95%CI: 14.5,68.7) protection by time to first Plasmodium falciparum infection. Only minimal local and systemic adverse events were reported. Discussion: Both vaccines showed promising results. However, RTS,S/AS01 has issues of low vaccine protection and serious adverse events that warrant further investigation. Both vaccines only protect against Plasmodium falciparum infection, but Plasmodium knowlesi malaria is of high importance in Malaysia.",Medical Journal of Malaysia,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '08', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-08-01'}}","child, comparative effectiveness, conference abstract, controlled study, drug efficacy, drug safety, Embase, female, field study, filtration, human, infant, low drug dose, Malaysia, male, Medline, pharmacokinetics, phase 1 clinical trial (topic), phase 3 clinical trial (topic), systematic review, weapon","[{'ancestor': ['child', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex', 'juvenile']}, {'ancestor': ['comparative effectiveness', 'comparative study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['controlled study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug activity', 'drug efficacy', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug safety', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'embase', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['field study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical analysis', 'diagnostic procedure', 'filtration', 'investigative procedures', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['child', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex', 'infant', 'juvenile']}, {'ancestor': ['analytical parameters', 'chemical parameters', 'dose', 'drug dose', 'drug therapy', 'low drug dose', 'medical procedures', 'parameters', 'pharmacological parameters', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['asia', 'eastern hemisphere', 'far east', 'geographic names', 'malaysia', 'southeast asia']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical trial (topic)', 'methodology', 'phase 1 clinical trial (topic)', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical trial (topic)', 'methodology', 'phase 3 clinical trial (topic)', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['social aspects and related phenomena', 'social problem', 'society', 'society and environment', 'weapon']}]","[{'initials': 'S.P.K.I.M.', 'surname': 'Mohamed Ghazali'}, {'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Sabirin'}]",Malaysia,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

745,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,"Efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors, tumor vaccines, and cellular immunotherapies in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer","Background: Checkpoint inhibitors, tumor vaccines or cellular immunotherapies demonstrated prolonged survival versus placebo or observation in several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to clarify the benefits of imunotherapy by a meta-analysis of RCTs data. Methods: We searched for RCTs investigating immunotherapy versus placebo or observation in patients with advanced NSCLC. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated as combined hazard ratios (HRs). The quality of the evidence was evaluated with the GRADE framework. Results: Overall, 23 RCTs including a total of 8,956 patients were identified (5,142 patients in the immunotherapy group and 3,814 in the placebo or observation group). High-to moderate-quality evidence indicated that immunotherapy prolonged OS (HR = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.84, P < 0.0001) and PFS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88, P < 0.0001). In subgroup analysis, high-to moderate-quality evidence revealed immunotherapy extended NSCLC survival and PFS in tumor vaccines (HR, 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92 and 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94 for OS and PFS, respectively), checkpoint inhibitors (0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.83 and 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.90, respectively), maintenance therapy (0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.83 and 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91, respectively), first-line therapy (0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98 and 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91, respectively), previous definitive chemotherapy (0.72, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.78 and 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95, respectively), and concurrent chemotherapy (0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95 and 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.91, respectively). There was a benefit of immunotherapy in previous definitive chemotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy and with concurrent administration of chemotherapy (OS as HR: P = 0.002 and P = 0.006, respectively). Conclusions: This analysis provides strong evidence for OS and PFS benefit of immunotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, particularly in those receiving tumor vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, maintenance and first-line therapy, previous definitive chemotherapy, and with concurrent chemotherapy.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '02', 'day': '01', 'content': '2018-02-01'}}","adult, cancer patient, cancer survival, chemoradiotherapy, conference abstract, controlled study, drug therapy, female, human, immunotherapy, maintenance therapy, male, meta analysis, overall survival, progression free survival, radiotherapy, randomized controlled trial (topic), systematic review","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer patient', 'miscellaneous named groups', 'named groups of persons', 'patient']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer survival', 'disease course', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'general aspects of disease', 'medical parameters', 'oncological parameters', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'survival']}, {'ancestor': ['cancer chemotherapy', 'cancer radiotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'drug therapy', 'medical procedures', 'partial body radiation', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'radiotherapy', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['controlled study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['drug therapy', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', 'immunotherapy', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['maintenance therapy', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['disease course', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'general aspects of disease', 'overall survival', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'survival']}, {'ancestor': ['disease course', 'diseases', 'epidemiological data', 'general aspects of disease', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'progression free survival', 'survival']}, {'ancestor': ['medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'radiotherapy', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical trial (topic)', 'controlled clinical trial (topic)', 'methodology', 'randomized controlled trial (topic)', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}]","[{'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Yu'}, {'initials': 'Q.', 'surname': 'Ou'}, {'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Wang'}, {'initials': 'Z.', 'surname': 'Liu'}, {'initials': 'T.', 'surname': 'Fu'}, {'initials': 'Q.', 'surname': 'Gao'}, {'initials': 'D.', 'surname': 'Lin'}, {'initials': 'H.', 'surname': 'Yao'}]",,,Failed to resolve DOI 10.1200/JCO.2018.36.5-suppl.165.

746,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Analyzing the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA): A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The tumor microenvironment in PDA is heterogeneous and immunosuppressive given the presence of regulatory T cells and exhausted effector T cells. Despite the upsurge of effective immunotherapeutic agents (IA) in other tumor types, the role in PDA remains unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of IA in PDA. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Elsevier/Embase, Wiley/Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov. Articles were selected per the following criteria: (1) Study participants had a diagnosis of PDA; (2) An IA was used in the trial. Titles, abstracts and full text articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers; disagreements were resolved by a third. Data extraction and analysis were performed by 3 independent reviewers. Descriptive analysis, mean, median, confidence interval and forest plots were used for statistical analysis. Results: We found 20,792 studies through the database, 16,105 remained after duplicates were removed and 15,889 were excluded due to irrelevance. Strict inclusion criteria were applied to the full text of 216 articles. The most common reason for exclusion were conference abstracts (44%) and ongoing trials (16%). Fiftyfour trials (39 metastatic (met), 12 adjuvant (Ad) and 3 neoadjuvant (nAd) met criteria for further analysis. Age range was 27-86 (median 61) and 52.3% were males. IA included cytokine therapy (33%), peptide vaccines (22%), dendritic cell vaccine (13%), oncolytic viruses (9%), CTLA-4 inhibitors (2%) and others. IA in met- PDA had a median overall survival (mOS) of 8.1 months (ms) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 55.4% (95% CI, 51.85-58.95). There was no statistical difference in DCR among IA subtypes (range 49- 60%) (p = 0.22). The mOS of Ad-PDA trials was 25 ms (historically comparable to gemcitabine, p = 0.75) and 18 ms for nAd-PDA. The most common Gr1/2 toxicities were skin reactions, fever, and chills and Gr3/4 were cytopenias, diarrhea, and mucositis. One death occurred due to neutropenic sepsis. Conclusions: IA demonstrates modest efficacy in the treatment of met-PDA albeit exhibits a favorable toxicity profile. Many trial results are available only in abstract format and some are ongoing.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'month': '02', 'day': '01', 'content':

764,"EMBASE, MEDLINE, unknown",Article,English,"Autoimmune diseases, HPV vaccine, Meta-analysis, Sistematic review",HPV vaccine and autoimmune diseases: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature,"Background. In the literature conflicting opinions are detectable on the onset of adverse events as autoimmune disease post HPV vaccine and often case reports describes the onset of one of these events, but don't emerge a clear relationship and we don't have data to support it. Methods. We carried out a systematic review to identify all scientific publications dealing with the correlation between vaccine anti-papillomavirus and new onset of autoimmune diseases. We searched the main scientific databases (PubMed, Sciverse Scopus, Web of knowledge and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials) for the following search terms: ""vaccine""; ""anti-papillomavirus""; ""autoimmune""; ""disease""; ""disorder"". To evaluate the safety of HPV vaccines, the dichotomous data on the number of subjects experiencing an autoimmune disorder in the study vaccine group and the placebo group were extracted from each study with subsequent determination of the risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. We combined data statistically using a random effects model. Results. We conduct a meta-analysis on six studies on bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine. The total number of subjects included in the meta-analysis comprised 243,289 in the vaccine group and 248,820 in control groups. Four of the six trials had a Jadad score of 3 or 4 indicating an adequate trial quality. The most frequent autoimmune disease observed across the six studies were musculoskeletal,CNS conditions and endocrinological conditions . The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated no correlation between autoimmune disorders and HPV vaccines (pooled OR 1.038, 95% CI 0.689-1.562). Conclusions. No correlation was identified for bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. It's therefore essential to correctly inform the general population in order to try to increase both Italian and international vaccination coverage.",Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'content': '2018-01-01'}}","article, human, meta analysis, systematic review, vaccination","[{'ancestor': ['article', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical and statistical procedures', 'mathematical phenomena', 'medical procedures', '@hit_startmeta analysis@hit_end', 'methodology', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'statistical analysis', 'statistical concepts', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}]","[{'initials': 'C.', 'surname': 'Genovese'}, {'initials': 'V.', 'surname': 'La Fauci'}, {'initials': 'A.', 'surname': 'Squeri'}, {'initials': 'G.', 'surname': 'Trimarchi'}, {'initials': 'R.', 'surname': 'Squeri'}]",Italy,,Failed to resolve DOI 10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2018.59.3.998.

Vaccines, which undergo rigorous safety testing prior to use in humans, are a rare cause of SJS/TEN and little is known about the frequency of such events and corresponding pathogenesis. Objective: Herein, we discuss a case of suspected TEN in a 19-year-old woman who received the meningococcal B vaccine (the first report of such an association) and conduct a systematic review of the associated literature. We also discuss management of this patient with a single dose of etanercept. Methods: Relevant literature was searched using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. Results: A total of 29 articles reporting EM, SJS, or TEN following vaccination were included from >5 countries. Of the 29, 22 articles reported EM, 6/29 reported SJS, and 4/29 reported TEN (3 articles reported cases of both EM and SJS/TEN). Conclusions: We suggest consideration of vaccines as an etiology for cases of SJS or TEN that begin with an EM-like presentation, and provide further evidence for the use of etanercept as a viable treatment for TEN.",Dermatology Online Journal,2018,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2018', 'content': '2018-01-01'}}","adult, apoptosis, case report, CD8+ T lymphocyte, clinical article, clinical feature, disease duration, drug efficacy, drug response, female, genetic susceptibility, Haemophilus influenzae type b, human, immune response, keratinocyte, plasmapheresis, review, treatment duration, vaccination, young adult","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['apoptosis', 'biological functions', 'cell aging, cell degeneration and cell survival', 'cell damage', 'cell death', 'cellular, subcellular and molecular biological phenomena and functions', 'regulated cell death']}, {'ancestor': ['case report', 'clinical study', 'in vivo study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['anatomical concepts', 'blood', 'blood and hemopoietic system', 'blood cell', 'body fluid', 'body fluids and secretions', 'cd8+ t lymphocyte', 'cells', 'cells by body anatomy', 'hemolymphatic system', 'immune system', 'leukocyte', 'lymphatic system', 'lymphocyte', 'lymphoid cell', 'mononuclear cell', 'organ systems', 't lymphocyte']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical article', 'clinical study', 'in vivo study', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical feature', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease', 'symptomatology']}, {'ancestor': ['disease course', 'disease duration', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug activity', 'drug efficacy', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug response', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'disease predisposition', 'disease resistance', 'diseases', 'general aspects of disease', 'genetic parameters', 'genetic predisposition', 'genetic susceptibility', 'heredity', 'inheritance', 'multifactorial inheritance', 'parameters', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['bacterium', 'gammaproteobacteria', 'gram negative bacterium', 'gram negative facultatively anaerobic rods', 'haemophilus', 'haemophilus influenzae', 'haemophilus influenzae type b', 'organism forms', 'organisms', 'organisms by outer appearance', 'pasteurellaceae', 'pasteurellales', 'prokaryotes by outer appearance', 'proteobacteria']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning organ systems', 'immune response', 'immunity']}, {'ancestor': ['anatomical concepts', 'cells', 'cells by body anatomy', 'epidermis', 'epidermis cell', 'epithelium cell', 'integumentary system', 'keratinocyte', 'organ systems', 'skin', 'skin cell']}, {'ancestor': ['apheresis', 'biological therapy', 'blood substitution', 'extracorporeal therapy', 'medical procedures', 'plasmapheresis', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'substitution therapy', 'therapy', 'transfusion']}, {'ancestor': ['@hit_startreview@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy', 'treatment duration']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex', 'young adult']}]","[{'initials': 'D.', 'surname': 'Chahal'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Aleshin'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Turegano'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Chiu'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Worswick'}]",United States,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

Development of an effective vaccine can provide important approach in malaria control strategies. Unfortunately, development of an effective vaccine for falciparum malaria has been hindered by the extreme complexity of malaria parasite biology, complex and diverse parasite genomes, and immune evasion by the parasites as well as the intricate nature of the parasites infection cycle. The aim of this review was to discuss the different approaches to malaria vaccine development until now. Methods: Scientific databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed) and SCOPUS were searched up to 30 Jan 2017 and the articles regarding malaria vaccine development were taken into examination. Results: Several strategies for malaria vaccine development including preerythrocytic vaccines, antibody-based subunit vaccines, vectored vaccines, whole sporozoite vaccines, genetically Attenuated parasites and sporozoite subunit vaccine, erythrocytic vaccines, sexual stage vaccine, transmission-blocking vaccine as well as synthetic peptides and conjugate vaccine has been introduced.

METHODS: Databases were searched from inception to July 2017. We used Cochrane Review risk-of-bias assessment tools of RCT for quality assessment. Our objective is seroprotection and seroconversion rate of the influenza vaccination influenced by probiotics / prebiotics. RESULTS: A total of 20 RCTs comprising 1,979 adults were included in our systematic review. Nine RCTs including 623 participants were pooled through a meta-analysis. Participants who take probiotics / prebiotics showed a significant improvement in H1N1 seroprotection rate(OR51.83, 95% CI 1.19 - 2.82, p50.006, I250%), in H3N2 seroprotection rate(OR5 2.85, 95% CI 1.59 -5.10, p<0.001, I250%) and in B strain seroconversion rate(OR5 2.11, 95% CI 1.38 - 3.21, p<0.001, I250%). In subgroup analysis according to intervention type, participants using probiotics had a significant better seroconversion rate in H3N2(OR53.52, 95% CI 1.45 - 8.53, p5 0.005, I25 63%). Meta-regression disclosed the effect of probiotics / prebiotics was significantly positive correlated with the duration of supplementson seroconversion rate for influenza B strain and seroconversion rate for influenza H1N1 strain. Subgroup analysis also showed that health elders supplemented with probiotics / prebiotics exhibited significant better response to all of the influenza strains than health adults and unhealthy elders.

PRAME protein plays a dual role in cancerogenesis. PRAME can prevent cell differentiation and apoptosis induction. Due to that, PRAME expression is associated with poor outcome. Deterioration of clinical outcome with PRAME activity is proven for patients with renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. On the other hand PRAME belongs to the group of cancer-testicular antigens. Like other cancer-testis antigens, PRAME is highly immunogenic. For example, PRAME-positive patients with lung cancer has better outcome than PRAME-negative. Perhaps, a balance between driver potential and immunogenicity exists. An effect of PRAME expression is nonsignificant in case of bladder cancer and ovarian cancer. Immunogenicity and high expression rate of PRAME make it an attractive target for immunotherapy. There are developed dendritic cell, T-cell-, peptide- and full protein-based vaccines. A search of literature for this review was performed using Web of science, Scopus and Pubmed databases with keyword ""PRAME"".

807,EMBASE,Article,Chinese,"Affordability, Chronic hepatitis B, Cost-effectiveness analysis, Hepatitis B vaccination, Prevention, Treatment",Cost-effectiveness of community-based treatment of chronic hepatitis B in China,"Objective: Since eliminating hepatitis B in China would need considerable public health resources, the economics problem of the strategy of community-based antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has become an important issue. The cost-effectiveness and affordability of the strategy were evaluated in this study. Methods: According to the advocacy on eliminating hepatitis B by WHO and the comprehensive protocol of community based prevention of major infectious diseases and the guideline for CHB prevention and treatment in China, the decision analytic Markov model was constructed with the parameters from national surveys or Meta-analysis. A cohort population aged 20-59 years was used as study subjects. The strategy of CHB antiviral treatment was compared with the strategies of hepatitis B vaccination and non-intervention, respectively. The costs and disability-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the strategies were calculated from the societal and payer perspectives. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) were calculated for the comparison of the strategies. One-way and probability sensitivity analysis were performed for uncertainty of the results. And the cost-effectiveness and affordability curves were introduced to estimate the budget impact on the strategies. Results: In the Chinese aged 20-59 years, the ICER of CHB antiviral treatment was 37 598.6 yuan (RMB) per QALYs and the ICERs were smaller in the low age groups, indicating that the antiviral treatment strategy is cost-effective and low age groups should be the priority population. The ICER of hepatitis B vaccination was -64 000.0 yuan (RMB) per QALYs, indicating that hepatitis B vaccination is cost saving. The CER of CHB antiviral treatment ranged from 731.8 to 1 813.3 yuan (RMB) per QALYs compared with hepatitis B vaccination, and the CER of CHB antiviral treatment was higher than that of hepatitis B vaccination in all age groups, indicating that hepatitis B vaccination would be more cost-effective than CHB antiviral treatment. The price of antiviral drug, entercavir, can influence the cost effectiveness of CHB antiviral treatment. If the price of entercavir declined half, CHB antiviral treatment would be cost-saving. The probability sensitivity analysis showed that people's willing to pay for CHB antiviral treatment should not be ignored, although the results of economics evaluation of CHB antiviral treatment were reliable. The results of affordability analysis indicated that the antiviral treatment strategy could not be implemented with the budget lower than 30 million yuan (RMB), the probability of implementing the strategy was 42.6% if the budget reaches 127 million yuan (RMB), and only when the budget reaches 269 million yuan (RMB), the goal of CHB antiviral treatment strategy can be fully realized. Conclusions: Although the strategy of CHB antiviral treatment as prevention in Chinese aged 20-59 years is cost-effective, it is not an appropriate public health measure due to the high cost. The cost effectiveness would be higher by conducting hepatitis B vaccination and then antiviral treatment in susceptible population.",Chinese Journal of Endemiology,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '07', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-07-01'}}","adult, article, China, community, cost control, cost effectiveness analysis, human, Markov chain, quality of life, sensitivity analysis, vaccination, World Health Organization","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['article', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['asia', 'china', 'eastern hemisphere', 'far east', 'geographic names']}, {'ancestor': ['community', 'social aspects and related phenomena', 'social environment', 'social structure', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['accounting', 'cost control', 'disease management', 'economic aspect', 'economic evaluation', 'financial management', 'health care concepts', 'health economics', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['cost effectiveness analysis', 'disease management', 'economic aspect', 'economic evaluation', 'health care concepts', 'health economics', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['chemical, physical and mathematical phenomena', 'markov chain', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical phenomena', 'model', 'nonbiological model', 'probability theory', 'stochastic model', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['disease management', 'health care concepts', 'quality of life']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'diagnostic procedure', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'sensitivity analysis']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['governmental organization', 'health care concepts', 'health care organization', 'intergovernmental organization', 'international cooperation', 'international organization', 'organization', 'organization and management', 'society', 'society and environment', 'united nations', 'world health organization']}]","[{'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'initials': 'P.', 'surname': 'Yang'}, {'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Cai'}, {'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Lin'}, {'initials': 'Y.', 'surname': 'Zou'}]",China,,Failed to resolve DOI 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2017.07.004.

819,EMBASE,Review,Spanish,"Adverse reactions to drugs, Mexico, Pharmacovigilance, Reports",Pharmacovigilance in Mexico,"Pharmacovigilance is the activity related with the detection, evaluation, understanding and prevention of adverse events, adverse reactions or the suspection of these, of events supposedly attributable to vaccination or immunization; or any other safety problem related with the use of drugs and vaccines. The aim of this study is to present a review on the pharmacovigilance work carried out in Mexico and the current problems it faces. In this regard, a systematic review was carried out in bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Science), a documentary analysis in public magazines and documented information by the World Health Organization, the Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) and the National Pharmacovigilance Centre (CNFV). In Mexico, Pharmacovigilance starts at the end of the 1980s, and in 1995 is when the National Pharmacovigilance Centre was created after 68 events of suspected adverse drug reaction were reported. Almost a decade after, Pharmacovigilance acquires greater interest due to outreach and education campaigns, resulting in an increase in notifications received in the National Pharmacovigilance Centre in 2005 with 7 950 reports of suspected adverse reactions, and by 2013 were received 35 386 reports. Nowadays, the main challenge is the improvement in the quality of information in these reports. In the last year, 49.3 % of the reports were grade 2 and 0.67 % were grade 3. Notifications with insufficient information are of little use to set a precedent of it or give proper follow up to an adverse reaction to a drug. Results shown that the tasks of promoting Pharmacovigilance in the country have been successful; however, there is a need to work on refining the documentation of the whole process.",Revista Cubana de Farmacia,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '04', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-04-01'}}","drug determination, drug screening, drug surveillance program, follow up, human, Mexico, review, vaccination, World Health Organization","[{'ancestor': ['analysis', 'assay', 'chemical analysis', 'diagnostic procedure', 'drug analysis', 'drug determination', 'medical procedures', 'pharmaceutics', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['analysis', 'chemical analysis', 'diagnostic procedure', 'drug analysis', 'drug screening', 'investigative procedures', 'medical procedures', 'pharmaceutics', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'screening']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical study', 'diagnostic procedure', 'drug surveillance program', 'in vivo study', 'medical procedures', 'monitoring', 'postmarketing surveillance', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'quality control procedures', 'safety procedure', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['aftercare', 'diagnostic procedure', 'evaluation and follow up', 'follow up', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'long term care', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['geographic names', 'mexico', 'north america', 'western hemisphere']}, {'ancestor': ['@hit_startreview@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}, {'ancestor': ['governmental organization', 'health care concepts', 'health care organization', 'intergovernmental organization', 'international cooperation', 'international organization', 'organization', 'organization and management', 'society', 'society and environment', 'united nations', 'world health organization']}]","[{'initials': 'M.A.', 'surname': 'Guardado Ruiz'}, {'initials': 'I.B.B.', 'surname': 'Camps'}, {'initials': 'I.R.', 'surname': 'Hern«≠ndez'}, {'initials': 'J.A.F.', 'surname': 'de la Torre'}, {'initials': 'M.A.', 'surname': 'L«¸pez'}]",Mexico,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

847,MEDLINE,Article,English,,"Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness--United States, January 2013","In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged É?æ6 months. Each season since 2004-05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent influenza-associated, medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI). This season, early data from 1,155 children and adults with ARI enrolled during December 3, 2012-January 2, 2013 were used to estimate the overall effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI. After adjustment for study site, but not for other factors, the estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 62% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 51%-71%). This interim estimate indicates moderate effectiveness, and is similar to a summary VE estimate from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trial data; final estimates likely will differ slightly. As of January 11, 2013, 24 states and New York City were reporting high levels of influenza-like illness, 16 states were reporting moderate levels, five states were reporting low levels, and one state was reporting minimal levels. CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices routinely recommend that annual influenza vaccination efforts continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Persons aged É?æ6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated. However, these early VE estimates underscore that some vaccinated persons will become infected with influenza; therefore, antiviral medications should be used as recommended for treatment in patients, regardless of vaccination status. In addition, these results highlight the importance of continued efforts to develop more effective vaccines.",MMWR.

865,EMBASE,Conference Abstract,English,,Immune infiltration of tumor microenvironment following immunotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme,"BACKGROUND: Autologous dendritic cell immunotherapy has been proven effective in treating tumours outside the central nervous system. Current evidence from phase I and II trials suggest a similar efficacy for central nervous system tumours as well and that an active immune response against these tumours can be generated. OBJECTIVE: We aim to review the literature to identify the types of immune responses against gliomas found to be generated by dendritic cell vaccinations and the types of immune cells subsequently infiltrating the glioma microenvironment. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by searching the online databases PubMEd, Google Scholar, and EMBASE with use of the keywords intratumoral, infiltration, lymphocytic, vaccination and gliomas. RESULTS: Seven studies reporting lymphocytic infiltration of gliomas microenvironment were identified. Three studies (42.8%) reported presence of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in 50%, 50% and 28.6% of included patients respectively in the post-vaccination specimens that were not present in the pre-vaccination samples. The remaining 4 (57.2%) reported an up to six-fold increase in the number of pre-existing lymphocytes following vaccination. CONCLUSION: Present data indicate that tumour infiltration by lymphocytes can be induced by dendritic cell immunotherapy and that this may positively affect clinical outcome. It still remains unclear which factors influence the above reaction and therefore prediction of response to treatment is still not possible.",Neuro-Oncology,2017,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2017', 'month': '01', 'day': '01', 'content': '2017-01-01'}}","adult, clinical outcome, conference abstract, dendritic cell, Embase, female, human, human cell, human tissue, immunotherapy, male, Medline, outcome assessment, phase 1 clinical trial (topic), prediction, systematic review, tumor associated leukocyte, tumor microenvironment, vaccination","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical outcome', 'disease management', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'treatment outcome']}, {'ancestor': ['conference abstract', 'conference paper', 'types of article', 'types of article or study']}, {'ancestor': ['accessory cell', 'anatomical concepts', 'antigen presenting cell', 'cells', 'cells by body anatomy', 'dendritic cell', 'immune system', 'organ systems']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'embase', 'information', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['female', 'groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['anatomical concepts', 'animal cell', 'animal tissue, cells or cell components', 'cells', 'cells by organism', 'eukaryotic cell', 'human cell', 'human tissue, cells or cell components', 'in vitro study', 'mammal cell', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['anatomical concepts', 'human tissue', 'human tissue, cells or cell components', 'in vitro study', 'tissues', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', 'immunotherapy', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['groups by age and sex', 'groups by sex', 'male']}, {'ancestor': ['bibliographic database', 'data base', 'data processing', 'information', 'medline', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['diagnostic procedure', 'disease management', 'evaluation and follow up', 'health care concepts', 'health care quality', 'medical procedures', 'outcome assessment', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'treatment outcome']}, {'ancestor': ['clinical trial (topic)', 'methodology', 'phase 1 clinical trial (topic)', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['prediction', 'prediction and forecasting', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['evidence based medicine', 'evidence based practice', 'methodology', '@hit_startreview@hit_end', '@hit_startsystematic review@hit_end', 'types of article', 'types of article or study', 'types of study']}, {'ancestor': ['anatomical concepts', 'blood', 'blood and hemopoietic system', 'blood cell', 'body fluid', 'body fluids and secretions', 'cells', 'cells by body anatomy', 'hemolymphatic system', 'immune system', 'leukocyte', 'organ systems', 'tumor associated leukocyte']}, {'ancestor': ['diseases', 'etiology', 'general aspects of disease', 'oncogenesis and malignant transformation', 'pathogenesis', 'tumor microenvironment']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}]","[{'initials': 'G.', 'surname': 'Sokratous'}, {'initials': 'S.', 'surname': 'Polyzoidis'}, {'initials': 'K.', 'surname': 'Ashkan'}]",United Kingdom,,Failed to resolve DOI 10.1093/neuonc/now293.

The question of the ambiguous role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of pneumonia and functional heterogeneity of macrophage cells, which are localized in the lungs were discussed. The classification of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) respectively on Toll-like receptors (TLRs), receptor-type C lectins (Clrs), a family of cytoplasmic proteins, retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG) -I-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding receptors oligomerized domens of NOD-like receptors (NLRs) were demonstrated in terms of their participation in the process of neutralizing pathogens lung infections. These new data about significance of cellular and molecular components of the innate immune system in a natural and acquired immunity to respiratory infections offers the prospect of a more focused management of this process with the help of vaccines, immunomodulators and other means of pharmacotherapy.

Objective: To identify and characterize publications related to immunization in the pediatric patient with CHD. Methodology: A systematized review with an integrative methodology of the evidence was carried out with a qualitative and descriptive approach. In the databases CUIDEN, LILACS, SciELO and Medline a search and selection of the publications related to the immunization of the pediatric patient with CHD; included scientific articles, full text, Spanish, English and Portuguese language published in 2011-2015. Data collected with a table of ex-profeso evidence. The articles were subjected to a content analysis to construct the category: prophylactic immunization. Results: Of the 8 articles selected, most were published in the United States of America (37.5%), English language (87.5%); 75% with level of evidence IV and degree of recommendation C. Vaccines applied in infants up to two years of age; effective prophylactic immunization against influenza, pneumococcus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella.

There are millions of category III rabies exposure cases in China every year, which are treated with rabies immunoglobulin(RIG)and the rabies vaccine. The price of RIG is relatively expensive, and the application of RIG is relatively complicated. The rate of RIG use in post exposure prophylaxis(PEP)for rabies exposure category É?Ω cases has remained low for a significant amount of time. Reducing the dosage of RIG could reduce the cost of PEP, while simplifying the use of RIG could make PEP easier. Together, these steps could improve the rate of RIG utilization in PEP. There are conflicting conclusions in studies of RIG on the immune effects of the rabies vaccine.Exploring the mechanism of action of RIG in the immune response to the rabies vaccine would help to explain the role of RIG in the immune effects mediated by the rabies vaccine.

Pneumococcal disease is the leading cause of deaths among vaccine preventable diseases in children and adults. Plain polysaccharide vaccine PPSV-23 and conjugated pneumnococcal polysaccharide vaccine PCV-13 are widely used to prevent pneumococcal disease and CAP in adults without immunosuppression. The review concerns the results of trials and meta-analysis of PPSV-23 and PCV-13 effectiveness in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and CAP prevention in immunocompetent adults. More and more expert immunization committees in different countries are taking into consideration uncertain effectiveness of PPSV-23 in CAP prevention in immunocompetent adults, and recommend the PCV-13 priority use for mass immunization campaigns in high-risk groups and elder population. Since the Russian Federation has started the PCV-13 vaccination campaign for early childhood only at the end of 2014, the anticipated serotype replacement should not be taken into consideration at the moment across all the age groups, and therefore the risk and age based approach to adult vaccination should be used with the PCV-13 priority.",Antibiotiki i khimioterapiia = Antibiotics and chemoterapy [sic],2016,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2016', 'month': '01', 'day': '01', 'content': '2016-01-01'}}","adult, child, drug effect, growth, development and aging, human, immunocompetence, immunology, innate immunity, mass immunization, microbiology, organization and management, preventive health service, procedures, Russian Federation, Streptococcus pneumoniae","[{'ancestor': ['adult', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex']}, {'ancestor': ['child', 'groups by age', 'groups by age and sex', 'juvenile']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'drug activity', 'drug effect', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacology']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism', 'growth, development and aging']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning organ systems', 'immune response', 'immunity', 'immunocompetence']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'biomedicine', 'immunology']}, {'ancestor': ['biological functions', 'biological phenomena and functions concerning organ systems', 'immunity', 'innate immunity']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', 'control', 'disease control', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'mass @hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy']}, {'ancestor': ['biology', 'biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'biomedicine', 'microbiology', 'natural science']}, {'ancestor': ['organization and management', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['care and caring', 'community care', 'health care', 'health care concepts', 'health care delivery', 'health care facilities and services', 'health service', 'preventive health service', 'social aspects and related phenomena', 'society', 'society and environment']}, {'ancestor': ['procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices']}, {'ancestor': ['eastern europe', 'eastern hemisphere', 'europe', 'geographic names', 'historical geographic names', 'russian federation', 'ussr']}, {'ancestor': ['bacilli', 'bacterium', 'firmicutes', 'gram positive bacterium', 'gram positive cocci', 'lactobacillales', 'organism forms', 'organisms', 'organisms by outer appearance', 'prokaryotes by outer appearance', 'streptococcaceae', 'streptococcus', 'streptococcus pneumoniae']}]","[{'initials': 'I.A.', 'surname': 'Guchev'}]",,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.

911,MEDLINE,Review,Polish,,"Autoimmune/infl ammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants, ASIA","There have been many cases of the appearance of autoantibodies and symptoms of disease after exposure to adjuvants, not only after breast augmentation with silicone implants, but also as a very rare vaccination side effect, such as Gulf war syndrome or macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome. Diseases whose symptoms developed after such adjuvant exposure are called autoimmune/ inì?èêlammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). The group of adjuvants includes not only silicone implants, silica, squalen and aluminium, but also ink components used for making tattoos. Analyzing the available reports on the inì?èêluence of adjuvants on the development of autoimmune diseases, the conclusion is that apart from long -term silicone exposure, the coexistence of other factors such as genetic or environmental is also necessary. Metaanalyses clearly do not conì?èêirm an increased risk of developing autoimmune disease after breast augmentation with silicone implants, or tattooing, but it seems that among these patients there is a group that is more predestined to develop disease symptoms. In the general population the beneì?èêits of vaccination are obvious, and the risk of severe adverse events following immunisation is incomparably lower than the risk of developing a speciì?èêic disease and its complications, also for patients with diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Because of data heterogeneity in previous studies and difì?èêiculties in diagnosing ASIA it seems necessary to conduct further analyses of adjuvantsÉ?? inì?èêluence on autoimmune disease development, and to reì?èêine ASIA diagnostic criteria, which now allow too easy a diagnosis of this syndrome.",Pomeranian journal of life sciences,2016,"{'pubDate': {'year': '2016', 'month': '01', 'day': '01', 'content': '2016-01-01'}}","chemically induced, human, immunology, tattooing, vaccination","[{'ancestor': ['chemically induced']}, {'ancestor': ['amniote', 'animal', 'ape', 'bilateria', 'catarrhini', 'chordata', 'deuterostomia', 'euarchontoglires', 'eukaryote', 'haplorhini', 'hominid', '@hit_starthuman@hit_end', 'human versus nonhuman data', 'mammal', 'opisthokonta', 'organisms', 'placental mammal', 'primate', 'simian', 'tetrapod', 'therian', 'types of article or study', 'types of study', 'vertebrate']}, {'ancestor': ['biomedical disciplines, science and art', 'biomedicine', 'immunology']}, {'ancestor': ['body modification', 'dermatological procedure', 'medical procedures', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'tattooing']}, {'ancestor': ['biological therapy', '@hit_startimmunization@hit_end', 'medical procedures', 'prevention', 'prevention and control', 'procedures', 'procedures, parameters and devices', 'prophylaxis', 'therapy', 'vaccination']}]","[{'initials': 'J.', 'surname': 'Stolarczyk'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Kubiè?'}, {'initials': 'M.', 'surname': 'Brzosko'}]",,,Failed to resolve DOI nan.
