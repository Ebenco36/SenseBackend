                                "Background: Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It occurs in newborn infants born to mothers who do not have sufficient circulating antibodies to protect the infant passively, by transplacental transfer. Prevention may be possible by the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of pregnant or non-pregnant women, or both, with tetanus toxoid, and the provision of clean delivery services. Tetanus toxoid consists of a formaldehyde-treated toxin that stimulates the production of antitoxin. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of tetanus toxoid, administered to women of reproductive age or pregnant women, to prevent cases of, and deaths from, neonatal tetanus. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2015), CENTRAL (The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library 2015, Issue 1), @hit_startPubMed@hit_end (1966 to 28 January 2015), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to 28 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of tetanus toxoid in pregnant women or women of reproductive age on numbers of neonatal tetanus cases and deaths. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results: Two effectiveness trials (9823 infants) and one safety trial (48 mothers) were included. The main outcomes were measured on infants born to a subset of those randomised women who became pregnant during the course of the studies. For our primary outcomes, there was no high-quality evidence according to GRADE assessments. One study (1182 infants) assessed the effectiveness of tetanus toxoid in comparison with influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in preventing neonatal tetanus deaths. A single dose did not provide significant protection against neonatal tetanus deaths, (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.24; 494 infants; GRADE: low-quality evidence). However, a two- or three-dose course did provide protection against neonatal deaths, (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 688 infants; GRADE: moderate-quality evidence). Administration of a two- or three-dose course resulted in significant protection when all causes of death are considered as an outcome (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55; 688 infants; GRADE: moderate-quality evidence). No effect was detected on causes of death other than tetanus. Cases of neonatal tetanus after at least one dose of tetanus toxoid were reduced in the tetanus toxoid group, (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.40; 1182 infants; GRADE: moderate-quality evidence). Another study, involving 8641 children, assessed the effectiveness of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid in comparison with cholera toxoid in preventing neonatal mortality after one or two doses. Neonatal mortality was reduced in the tetanus-diphtheria toxoid group (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.82). In preventing deaths at four to 14 days, neonatal mortality was reduced again in the tetanus-diphtheria toxoid group (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.55). The quality of evidence as assessed using GRADE was found to be low. The third small trial assessed that pain at injection site was reported more frequently among pregnant women who received tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis than placebo (RR 5.68, 95% CI 1.54 to 20.94; GRADE: moderate-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: Available evidence supports the implementation of @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end practices on women of reproductive age or pregnant women in communities with similar, or higher, levels of risk of neonatal tetanus, to the two study sites."

                                "Background: IL17-targeted therapeutics are being developed to treat psoriasis. IL17 is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, and the implications of IL17 blockade are not yet well characterized. Objective: To review the implications of IL17 deficiency to determine potential implications of IL17 blockade. Methods: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end was searched for articles related to; basic biology of IL17, in vitro and in vivo studies of IL17 deficiency, animal or human models of IL17 deficiency, and induced deficiency with anti-IL17 deficiency. Of 104 articles, 46 were included in this review. Results: Deficiencies in the IL17 pathway can result in both bacterial and fungal infections and increased tumor growth. IL17 deficiency states are associated with susceptibility to infections from Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans. IL17 deficiency attenuates rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity and irritable bowel disease and is protective in lung cancer. Limitations: Ultimately, clinical trials will determine the side effects of IL17 targeted therapeutics. Conclusion: The implications of the information found in this review demonstrate potential effects to consider when using IL17 targeted therapeutics in the treatment of psoriasis."

                                "Background: Hypodermic needles of different sizes (gauges and lengths) can be used for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end procedures. The gauge (G) refers to the outside diameter of the needle tubing. The higher the gauge number, the smaller diameter of the needle (eg a 25 G needle is 0.5 mm in diameter and is narrower than a 23 G needle (0.6 mm)). Many @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are recommended for injection into muscle (intramuscularly), although some are delivered subcutaneously (under the skin) and intradermally (into skin). Choosing an appropriate length and gauge of a needle may be important to ensure that a @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is delivered to the appropriate site and produces the maximum immune response while causing the least possible harm. There are some conflicting guidelines regarding the lengths and gauges of needles that should be used for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end procedures in children and adolescents. Objectives: To assess the effects of using needles of different lengths and gauges for administering @hit_startvaccines@hit_end to children and adolescents on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end immunogenicity (the ability of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to elicit an immune response), procedural pain, and other reactogenicity events (adverse events following @hit_startvaccine@hit_end administration). Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (The @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library 2014, Issue 10), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end and @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end in Progress via Ovid (1947 to November 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end via Ovid (1974 to November 2014), and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end via EBSCOhost (1982 to November 2014). We also searched reference lists of articles and textbooks, the proceedings of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end conferences, and three clinical trial registers. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of using hypodermic needles of any gauge or length to administer any type of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to people aged from birth to 24 years. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Three review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We rated the quality of evidence using the GRADE system. Main results: We included five trials involving 1350 participants. Data for the primary review outcomes were either absent (for the incidence of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases) or limited (for procedural pain and crying). The available evidence was compromised by the use of surrogate immunogenicity outcomes, incomplete blinding of outcome assessors, and imprecision for some outcomes. The evidence from two small trials was insufficient to allow any confident statements to be made about the effects of the needles evaluated in the trials on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end immunogenicity and reactogenicity. The remaining three trials (1135 participants) contributed data to comparisons between 25 G 25 mm, 23 G 25 mm, and 25 G 16 mm needles. These trials involved infants predominantly aged two to six months undergoing intramuscular @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the anterolateral thigh using the World Health Organization (WHO) injection technique (skin stretched flat, needle inserted at a 90\u00b0 angle and up to the needle hub in healthy infants). The @hit_startvaccines@hit_end administered were combination @hit_startvaccines@hit_end containing diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis antigens (DTwP). In some trials, the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end also contained Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwP-Hib) and hepatitis B (DTwP-Hib-HepB) antigen components. We found moderate quality evidence from one trial that there is probably little or no difference in immune response, defined in terms of the proportion of seroprotected infants, between using 25 G 25 mm, 23 G 25 mm, or 25 G 16 mm needles to administer a series of three doses of a DTwP-Hib @hit_startvaccine@hit_end at ages two, three, and four months (numbers of participants in @hit_startanalyses@hit_end range from 309 to 402. Immune response to pertussis antigen not measured). 25 mm needles (either 23 G or 25 G) probably lead to fewer severe local reactions (extensive redness and swelling) and fewer non-severe local reactions (any redness, swelling, tenderness or hardness (composite outcome)) after DTwP-Hib @hit_startvaccination@hit_end compared with 25 G 16 mm needles. We estimate that one fewer infant will experience a severe local reaction after the first @hit_startvaccine@hit_end dose for every 25 infants @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end with the longer rather than the shorter needle (number needed to treat (NNT) 25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 15 to 100)). We estimate that one fewer infant will experience a non-severe local reaction at 24 hours after the first, second, and third @hit_startvaccine@hit_end doses for every five to eight infants @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end with the longer rather than the shorter needle (NNTs range from 5 (95% CI 4 to 10) to 8 (95% CI 5 to 34)) (moderate quality evidence, one trial for first and second doses, two trials for third dose, numbers of participants in @hit_startanalyses@hit_end range from 413 to 528). Using a wider gauge needle (23 G 25 mm) may slightly reduce procedural pain (low quality evidence) and probably leads to a slight reduction in the duration of crying time immediately after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (moderate quality evidence) compared with a narrower gauge (25 G 25 mm) needle (one trial, 320 participants). The effects are probably not large enough to be of any clinical relevance. The 25 G 25 mm needle may produce a small reduction in the incidence of local reactions after each dose of a DTwP @hit_startvaccine@hit_end compared with the 23 G 25 mm needle, but the effect estimates are imprecise (low quality evidence, two trials, numbers of participants in @hit_startanalyses@hit_end range from 100 to 459). The comparative effects of 23 G 25 mm, 25 G 25 mm, and 25 G 16 mm needles on the incidence of post-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end fever, persistent inconsolable crying, and other systemic events such as drowsiness, loss of appetite, and vomiting are uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. Authors' conclusions: Using 25 mm needles (either 23 G or 25 G) for intramuscular @hit_startvaccination@hit_end procedures in the anterolateral thigh of infants using the WHO injection technique probably reduces the occurrence of local reactions while achieving a comparable immune response to 25 G 16 mm needles. These findings are applicable to healthy infants aged two to six months receiving combination DTwP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with a reactogenic whole-cell pertussis antigen component. These @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are predominantly used in developing countries. The applicability of the findings to @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with acellular pertussis components and other @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with different reactogenicity profiles is uncertain."

                                "Background: Infections during pregnancy confers increased risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, the case for advocating Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and viral Influenza @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end in pregnancy is still debatable. Objectives: To assess the impact of Hib and viral Influenza @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal and infant health outcomes compared to placebo/control. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (29 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled clinical trials (including cluster-randomised trials) and quasi-randomised trials evaluating Hib or viral influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy compared with no @hit_startvaccination@hit_end or placebo. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results: Two trials were included this review. One (involving 213 women and 213 neonates) evaluated the impact of Hib @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy and the other study (involving 2116 women and 2049 neonates) evaluated the impact of viral influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy. Overall, the HiB @hit_startvaccination@hit_end trial was judged to be at 'high risk of bias' due to inadequate randomisation while the other trial was judged to be at 'low risk of bias'. Hib @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy versus placebo One trial involving 213 women and 213 neonates evaluating the impact of Hib @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy was included under this comparison. The study did not report on any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes (including mortality, respiratory tract infection and sepsis) or secondary outcomes (including adverse events) except preterm delivery. There was no clear difference between the Hib @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and placebo control groups in terms of preterm delivery (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 13.86, one study, 213 participants), fetal distress (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.26, one study, 213 infants), intubation (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.95, one study, 213 infants) and neonatal jaundice (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.97, one study, 213 infants). We could not grade the evidence for quality due to lack of outcome data. Viral influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy versus placebo One trial involving 2116 women and 2049 infants evaluating the impact of trivalent inactivated influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (IIV3) during pregnancy was included under this comparison. There was no clear difference between the viral influenza and placebo control group in terms of most of this review's primary outcomes: maternal death (RR 4.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 103.24, moderate quality evidence), infant death up to 175 days after birth (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.37, moderate quality evidence), perinatal death (stillbirth and death in the first week of life) (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.38, moderate quality evidence), influenza-like illness in women (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.16) or their babies (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09), any respiratory illness in women (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, high quality evidence) or their babies (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07, high quality evidence). There were also no clear differences between @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and placebo control groups in terms of maternal hospitalisation for any infection (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 5.49; 2116 women, moderate quality evidence), and neonatal hospitalisation for sepsis (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.50; 2049 infants, moderate quality evidence). However, viral influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy was associated with a reduction in reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed influenza among infants (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.88, one study, 2049 infants) and women (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86, one study, 2116 women). In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, there were no clear differences in terms of the impact on pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, preterm labour and stillbirth), hospitalisation for respiratory infection among women and infants. Similarly, there was no difference between the viral influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and placebo control groups in terms of any adverse systemic reactions. Authors' conclusions: There is limited evidence (from one small trial at a high risk of bias) on the effectiveness on Hib during pregnancy for improving maternal, neonatal and infant health outcomes. Evidence from one large high quality trial on the effectiveness of viral influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end during pregnancy suggests reduced RT-PCR confirmed influenza among women and their babies, suggesting the potential of this strategy for scale up but further evidence from varying contexts is required. Further trials for both Hib and viral influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end with appropriate study designs and suitable comparison groups are required. There are currently two 'ongoing' studies - these will be incorporated into the review in future updates."

                                "Background: Extensive evidence exists showing @hit_startanalgesic@hit_end effects of sweet solutions for newborns and infants. It is less certain if the same @hit_startanalgesic@hit_end effects exist for children one year to 16 years of age. This is an updated version of the original @hit_startCochrane@hit_end review published in Issue 10, 2011 (Harrison 2011) titled Sweet tasting solutions for reduction of needle-related procedural pain in children aged one to 16 years. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of sweet tasting solutions or substances for reducing needle-related procedural pain in children beyond one year of age. Search methods: Searches were run to the end of June 2014. We searched the following databases: the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Database of @hit_startSystematic Reviews@hit_end, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startPsycINFO@hit_end, and ACP Journal Club (all via OvidSP), and CINAH (via EBSCOhost). We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria: Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT) in which children aged one year to 16 years, received a sweet tasting solution or substance for needle-related procedural pain. Control conditions included water, non-sweet tasting substances, pacifier, distraction, positioning/containment, breastfeeding, or no treatment. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Outcome measures included crying duration, composite pain scores, physiological or behavioral pain indicators, self-report of pain or parental or healthcare professional-report of the child's pain. We reported mean differences (MD), weighted mean difference (WMD), or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect or random-effects models as appropriate for continuous outcome measures. We reported risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the I@sup_begin2@sup_end statistic to assess between-study heterogeneity. Main results: We included one unpublished and seven published studies (total of 808 participants); four more studies and 478 more participants than the 2011 review. Six trials included young children aged one to four years receiving sucrose or candy lollypops for @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end pain compared with water or no treatment. Usual care included topical anaesthetics, upright parental holding, and distraction. All studies were well designed blinded RCTs, however, five of the six studies had a high risk of bias based on small sample sizes. Two studies included school-aged children receiving sweet or unsweetened chewing gum before, or before and during, @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end and blood collection. Both studies, conducted by the same author, had a high risk of bias based on small sample sizes. Results for the toddlers/pre-school children were conflicting. Duration of cry, using a random-effects model, was not significantly reduced by sweet taste (six trials, 520 children, WMD -15 seconds, 95% CI -54 to 24, I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 94%). Composite pain score at time of first needle was reported in four studies (n = 121 children). The scores were not significantly different between the sucrose and control group (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.75, I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 86%). A Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale score > 4 was significantly less common in the sucrose group compared to the control group in one study (n = 472, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.67; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.20; NNTB 3, 95% CI 3 to 5; tests for heterogeneity not applicable. For school-aged children, chewing sweet gum before needle-related painful procedures (two studies, n = 111 children) or during the procedures (two studies, n = 103 children) did not significantly reduce pain scores. A comparison of the Faces Pain Scale scores in children chewing sweet gum before the procedures compared with scores of children chewing unsweetened gum revealed a WMD of -0.15 (95% CI -0.61 to 0.30). Similar results were found when comparing the chewing of sweet gum with unsweetened gum during the procedure (WMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.74). The Colored @hit_startAnalogue@hit_end Scale for children chewing sweet gum compared to unsweetened gum before the procedure was not significantly different (WMD 0.24 (-0.69 to 1.18)) nor was it different when children chewed the gum during the procedure (WMD 0.86 (95% CI -0.12 to 1.83)). There was no heterogeneity for any of these @hit_startanalyses@hit_end in school-aged children (I@sup_begin2@sup_end = 0%). Authors' conclusions: Based on the eight studies included in this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end update, two of which were subgroups of small numbers of eligible toddlers from larger studies, and three of which were pilot RCTs with small numbers of participants, there is insufficient evidence of the @hit_startanalgesic@hit_end effects of sweet tasting solutions or substances during acutely painful procedures in young children between one and four years of age. Further rigorously conducted, adequately powered RCTs are warranted in this population. Based on the two studies by the same author, there was no evidence of @hit_startanalgesic@hit_end effects of sweet taste in school-aged children. As there are other effective evidence-based strategies available to use in this age group, further trials are not warranted. Despite the addition of four studies in this review, conclusions have not changed since the last version of the review."

                                "Background: RA is an autoimmune condition with a worldwide prevalence of 1%. The approach to treatment has evolved due to novel therapeutic agents and management regimens assessing systemic, as well as joint, involvement. The rationale for monitoring systemic effects of RA is their association with a poorer prognosis. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is recognized as the leading cause of death, accounting for 40% mortality. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end indicate the prevalence of depression to be 38.8%. Furthermore, greater incidence of fractures and respiratory tract infections occur, as compared with the general population. This audit aims to evaluate the management of systemic RA in a general practice setting, as recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Arthritis Research UK. Methods: All RA patients over 16 years of age registered at Hammond Road Surgery were audited. The SystmOne practice database was searched between October and November 2014. The audit criteria were the percentage of patients with RA who had received an annual review in the preceding 15 months; aged 30-84 years who had received a CVD risk assessment in the preceding 15 months; who had been offered appropriate interventions to reduce CVD; screened for depression; aged 50-90 years who had received an assessment of fracture risk in the preceding 27 months; and offered influenza and pneumococcus immunizations. The audit target was 100%. Results: A total of 5100 patients were registered at the practice. 31 RA patients were eligible, resulting in a practice prevalence of 0.61%. The mean age was 64.2 years. 29 (90%) patients were South-East Asian and 23 (74.2%) were female. All patients had established RA (more than 2 years since diagnosis) as per the Guideline Development Group criteria. Patients meeting each audit criterion are presented: annual RA review (n=26; 83.9%); CVD risk assessment (n=25; 80.6%); CVD reduction interventions (n=25; 80.6%); fracture risk assessment (n=22; 71.0%); @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end (n=16; 51.6%); and depression screen (n=8; 25.8%). The RA-adjusted risk assessment tools used were QRISK for CVD, FRAX for fractures and PHQ-9 for depression. Conclusion: The practice prevalence is lower than the average prevalence and therefore the pick-up of RA is poor, possibly due to a lower prevalence in the South-East Asian diaspora. Annual RA reviews, CVD management and fracture screening occurred most frequently, possibly because these tasks were notified to the clinician electronically. Offering @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end and depression screening did not occur as readily. All patients @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end were above the age of 65 years and therefore were routinely @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end based on their age, as opposed to their diagnosis. Similarly, all patients screened for depression were patients already with depression and were on pharmacological treatment. The primary recommendation is to incorporate these two interventions into the annual review, perhaps through the use of pop-up alerts on the computer system."

                                "Background: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common infectious diseases in children. It has been reported that 64% of infants have an episode of AOM by the age of six months and 86% by one year. Although most cases of AOM are due to bacterial infection, it is commonly triggered by a viral infection. In most children it is self limiting, but it does carry a risk of complications. Since antibiotic treatment increases the risk of antibiotic resistance, influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end might be an effective way of reducing this risk by preventing the development of AOM. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in reducing the occurrence of acute otitis media (AOM) in infants and children. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1946 to July week 1, 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (2010 to July 2014), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (1981 to July 2014), LILACS (1982 to July 2014), Web of Science (1955 to July 2014) and reference lists of articles to July 2014. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end with placebo or no treatment in infants and children aged younger than six years old. We included children of either sex and of any ethnicity, with or without a history of recurrent AOM. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently screened studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We performed statistical @hit_startanalyses@hit_end using the random-effects and fixed-effect models and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: We included 10 trials (six trials in high-income countries and four multicentre trials in high-, middle- and low-income countries) involving 16,707 children aged six months to six years. Eight trials recruited participants from a healthcare setting. Nine trials (and all five trials that contributed to the primary outcome) declared funding from @hit_startvaccine@hit_end manufacturers. Four trials reported adequate allocation concealment and nine trials reported adequate blinding of participants and personnel. Attrition was low for all trials included in the @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. The primary outcome showed a small reduction in at least one episode of AOM over at least six months of follow-up (five trials, 4736 participants: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.96; RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.02; NNTB 25, 95% CI 15 to 50). The subgroup @hit_startanalyses@hit_end (i.e. number of courses, settings, seasons or types of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end administered) showed no differences. There was a reduction in the use of antibiotics in @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end children (two trials, 1223 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83; RD -0.15, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.00). There was no significant difference in the utilisation of health care for the one trial that provided sufficient information to be included. The use of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end resulted in a significant increase in fever (six trials, 10,199 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.24; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.05) and rhinorrhoea (six trials, 10,563 children: RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29; RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.16) but no difference in pharyngitis. No major adverse events were reported. Compared to the protocol, the review included a subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of AOM episodes by season, and changed the types of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end from a secondary outcome to a subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Authors' conclusions: Influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end results in a small reduction in AOM. The observed reduction with the use of antibiotics needs to be considered in the light of current recommended practices aimed at avoiding antibiotic overuse. Safety data from these trials are limited. The benefits may not justify the use of influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end without taking into account the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy in reducing influenza and safety data. The quality of the evidence was high to moderate. Additional research is needed."

                                "Background: Measles is still an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality globally, despite increasing @hit_startvaccine@hit_end coverage. Zinc plays a significant role in the maintenance of normal immunological functions, therefore supplements given to zinc-deficient children will increase the availability of zinc and could reduce measles-related morbidity and mortality. Objectives: To assess the effects of zinc supplementation in reducing morbidity and mortality in children with measles. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end (1946 to June week 3, 2014), @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (1974 to June 2014), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (1981 to June 2014), LILACS (1982 to June 2014), Web of Science (1985 to June 2014) and BIOSIS Previews (1985 to June 2014). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effects of zinc in reducing morbidity and mortality in children with measles. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data on outcomes, details of the interventions and other study characteristics using a standardised data extraction form. We used the risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio as measures of effect with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included only one study and we did not conduct any @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Main results: One RCT met our inclusion criteria. The study was conducted in India and included 85 children diagnosed with measles and pneumonia. The trial showed that there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 8.14). Also, there was no significant difference in time to absence of fever between the two groups (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.74). No treatment-related side effects were reported in either group. The overall quality of the evidence can be described as very low. Authors' conclusions: We cannot draw any definite conclusions from this review about the effects of zinc supplementation on clinical outcomes of children with measles due to the very low quality of the evidence available. There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effect of zinc supplementation in measles."

                                "Background: Approximately 450,000 children worldwide die of pneumococcal infections each year. The development of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials adds to the difficulty of treatment of diseases and emphasizes the need for a preventive approach. Newborn @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedules could substantially reduce the impact of pneumococcal disease in @hit_startimmunized@hit_end children, but do not have an effect on the morbidity and mortality of infants less than three months of age. Pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy may be a way of preventing pneumococcal disease during the first months of life before the pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end administered to the infant starts to produce protection. Objectives: To assess the effect of pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy for preventing infant infection. Search methods: We searched the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials in pregnant women comparing pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end with placebo or doing nothing, or with another @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to prevent infant infections. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results: Seven trials were included, but only six trials (919 participants) contributed data. There was no evidence that pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy reduces the risk of neonatal infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.46; two trials, 241 pregnancies, low quality evidence). Although the data suggest an effect in reducing pneumococcal colonization in infants by 16 months of age (average RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.98; one trial, 56 pregnancies), there was no evidence of this effect in infants at two to three months of age (average RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.46 to 2.78; two trials, 146 pregnancies, low quality evidence) or by six to seven months of age (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.08; two trials, 148 pregnancies, low quality evidence). None of the trials included in this review reported neonatal death as a result of pneumococcal infection. Neonatal antibody levels were reported as geometric mean and 95% CI. There were inconsistent results between studies. Two studies showed significantly higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in cord blood in the pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end group when compared with the control group for all serotypes. In contrast, another trial showed no difference in neonatal antibody levels between the pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end group and the control group. Maternal antibody levels were also reported as geometric mean and 95% CI. One study showed significantly higher IgG levels in maternal serum in women @hit_startimmunized@hit_end with pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end when compared with control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end regardless of any serotypes. Another study showed significantly higher maternal antibody levels only for serotype 14, but no evidence of an effect for other serotypes. The percentage of women with seroprotection was measured in one trial at delivery and at 12 months post-delivery. At delivery, results favored the intervention group for serotype 6 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.69), serotype 14 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.56) and serotype 19 (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.76). There were no group differences seen at 12 months post-delivery for serotypes 6 or 14 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12 and RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, respectively), but results favored the intervention group for serotype 19 (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.85). No significant difference for tenderness at the injection site between women who received pneumococcal @hit_startvaccine@hit_end and those who received control @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (average RR 3.20; 95% CI 0.32 to 31.54; two trials, 130 women). The overall quality of evidence is low for primary outcomes. Most outcomes had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, and most of the included trials had small numbers of participants and few events which led to downgrading evidence for imprecision of findings. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to assess whether pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end during pregnancy could reduce infant infections."
