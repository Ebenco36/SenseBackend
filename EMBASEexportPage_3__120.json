                                "Background: Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at high risk of hospitalization. Medications are a potentially modifiable risk factor for hospitalizations. Objective: Our objective was to @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end the association between medications or prescribing patterns and hospitalizations from LTCFs. Methods: We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (@hit_startCINAHL@hit_end) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) from inception to August 2017 for longitudinal studies reporting associations between medications or prescribing patterns and hospitalizations. Two independent investigators completed the study selection, data extraction and quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Results: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 22 cohort studies, five case\u2013control studies, one case-time-control study and one case-crossover study, investigating 13 different medication classes and two prescribing patterns were included. An RCT demonstrated that high-dose influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end reduced all-cause hospitalization compared with standard-dose @hit_startvaccination@hit_end (risk ratio [RR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88\u20130.98). Another RCT found no difference in hospitalization rates between oseltamivir as influenza treatment and oseltamivir as treatment plus prophylaxis (treatment = 4.7%, treatment and prophylaxis = 3.5%; p = 0.7). The third RCT found no difference between multivitamin/mineral supplementation and hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% CI 0.74\u20131.20) or emergency department visits (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.76\u20131.47). Two cohort studies demonstrated influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end reduced hospitalization. Four studies suggested polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) increased all-cause hospitalization. However, associations between polypharmacy (two studies), PIMs (one study) and fall-related hospitalizations were inconsistent. Inconsistent associations were found between psychotropic medications with all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations (11 studies). Warfarin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pantoprazole and vinpocetine but not long-term acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), statins, trimetazidine, digoxin or \u03b2-blockers were associated with all-cause or cause-specific hospitalizations in single studies of specific resident populations. Most cohort studies assessed prevalent rather than incident medication exposure, and no studies considered time-varying medication use. Conclusion: High-quality evidence suggests influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end reduces hospitalization. Polypharmacy and PIMs are consistently associated with increased all-cause hospitalization."

                                "Herpes zoster is a major health burden that can affect individuals of any age. It is seen more commonly among individuals aged \u226550 years, those with immunocompromised status, and those on immunosuppressant drugs. It is caused by a reactivation of varicella zoster virus infection. Cell-mediated @hit_startimmunity@hit_end plays a role in this reactivation. Fever, pain, and itch are common symptoms before the onset of rash. Post-herpetic neuralgia is the most common complication associated with herpes zoster. Risk factors and complications associated with herpes zoster depend on the age, immune status, and the time of initializing treatment. Routine @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for individuals over 60 years has shown considerable effect in terms of reducing the incidence of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia. Treatment with antiviral drugs and @hit_startanalgesics@hit_end within 72 hours of rash onset has been shown to reduce severity and complications associated with herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia. This study mainly focuses on herpes zoster using articles and reviews from @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end library, and a manual search from Google Scholar. We cover the incidence of herpes zoster, gender distribution, seasonal and regional distribution of herpes zoster, incidence of herpes zoster among immunocompromised individuals, incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia following a zoster infection, complications, management, and prevention of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia."

                                "High-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) are the most prevalent viruses in human diseases including cervical cancers. Expression of E6 protein has already been reported in cervical cancer cases, excluding normal tissues. Continuous expression of E6 protein is making it ideal to develop therapeutic @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against hrHPVs infection and cervical cancer. Therefore, we carried out a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of multiple hrHPVs to predict the most potential prophylactic peptide @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. In this study, immunoinformatics approach was employed to predict antigenic epitopes of hrHPVs E6 proteins restricted to 12 Human HLAs to aid the development of peptide @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against hrHPVs. Conformational B-cell and CTL epitopes were predicted for hrHPVs E6 proteins using ElliPro and NetCTL. The potential of the predicted peptides were tested and validated by using systems biology approach considering experimental concentration. We also investigated the binding interactions of the antigenic CTL epitopes by using docking. The stability of the resulting peptide-MHC I complexes was further studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The simulation results highlighted the regions from 46\u201362 and 65\u201376 that could be the first choice for the development of prophylactic peptide @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against hrHPVs. To overcome the worldwide distribution, the predicted epitopes restricted to different HLAs could cover most of the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and would help to explore the possibility of these epitopes for adaptive immunotherapy against HPVs infections."

                                "Without any doubt, Botulinum Toxin is an amazing molecule with diverse clinical effects since the 1970S. The clinical use of Botulinum Toxin Type A and Type B (BONT-A and BONTB) has revolutionized the practice of medicine over the past 30 years. The safety and effectiveness of injectable Botulinum Toxin have been well established in both aesthetic and medical indications. However to reach the desired endpoints and to maintain the efficacy, the frequency of injections is required. By increasing the numbers of patients without favorable therapeutic responses, a new concern has re-emerged on the immunoresistance and loss of effectiveness to treatment. Primary and secondary non-responses have been hypothesized to be associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the neurotoxins. Various factors for the production of neutralizing antibodies has been proposed, including the manufacturing process of Botulinum Toxin, the antigenic protein load, the total toxin dose, booster injections, prior @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and exposure to fake products on the market. The purpose of this work was to systematically assess published studies and perform an @hit_startanalysis@hit_end to determine how significant it is clinical relevance of immunoresistance to Botulinum Neurotoxins. A literature search was done by searching @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, @hit_startPubmed@hit_end, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (@hit_startCINAHL@hit_end), and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library databases of clinical trials. The results of this @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end will be discussed to provide clinicians an updated high level of evidence for clinical importance of immunogenicity to Botulinum toxin formulations."

                                "Background: There are many recommendations on the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis and treatment of travellers' diarrhoea (TD). As pharmacists with a special interest in antimicrobial stewardship, we examine and offer our perspective on advice that is recommended to travellers in terms of prevention, treatment and management of TD with a focus on antibiotic use and resistance. Methods: Publications on TD were identified through @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Google Scholar and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library databases searches using search terms 'travellers diarrhoea', 'travellers diarrhoea', 'travellers' diarrhoea' 'guidelines', 'expert opinion', 'expert reviews', 'South Asia' and 'South East Asia' (S and SE Asia), 'antibiotics', 'resistance genes', 'travel advice', 'pharmacists', 'guidelines', 'prevention' and 'treatment'. References of articles were also screened for additional relevant studies. Results: Whilst most guidelines and expert reviews were in agreement with the restricted use of antibiotics unless there was a clinical need, the @hit_startliterature review@hit_end identified gaps in research into behaviours of travellers regarding non-compliance with the pre-travel advice provided and the need for in depth training and education for all healthcare professionals in providing 'tailored' advice for travellers going to high-risk destinations. Conclusions: Travellers should be made aware of the problems of antimicrobial resistance in their destination and home countries and offered alternative forms of prophylaxis for TD. Strategies for prevention of TD, other than the use of antibiotics, also need to be emphasized. All healthcare professionals involved in giving advice about TD should be familiar with the epidemiology of the condition as this will inform responsible behaviours, risk assessment and management strategies in different geographical areas."

                                "Context: Information on the measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is important for future measles control policies. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end history and laboratory confirmation during the development of the AIK measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in Iran is surveyed in this article. In addition, the production results and effectiveness of the Razi AIK-C/MRC-5 measles strain are compared with other @hit_startvaccine@hit_end strains. Evidence Acquisition: The current study was carried out to aim local measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end manufacturing and consequences of that in Iran, using various search engines. Almost complete search carried out in medical databases including @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Scopus, Web of Science, Scientific Information Database, IranMedex, Magiran and Google Scholar. Results: The morbidity rate of measles during the pre-@hit_startvaccine@hit_end era of this disease was 10,000 cases/year in 1970-1972. In 1997, the rate was 24 in 1000 cases. After using the high quality Razi measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end between 1995 and 2013, the number of measles-positive cases declined to a maximum of 35 cases per year, while the country\u2019s population increased by more than 2.5 times. The median of the Razi measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end efficacy (VE) was > 92.1% compared with that of the pre-@hit_startvaccine@hit_end era. For patients who received 2 doses of the measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end at either 6 and 12 months or 9 and 18 months of age, the median VEs were > 90.0% (interquartile range [IQR], 83%-97%) and 92.0% (IQR, 86%-98%), respectively. The age at @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and strain type used in the @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are reviewed in this article. Conclusions: The effectiveness of the local Razi measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end resulted in a significant decline in measles mortality and morbidity in Iran. Two doses of the Razi measles (MR) or measles combination (MMR) @hit_startvaccine@hit_end provided excellent protection against measles. The seroprevalance of the measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in Iran revealed that more than 90% of Iranians are seropositive for the measles virus."

                                "Purpose To provide current knowledge on respiratory virus-induced heterologous @hit_startimmunity@hit_end (HI) with a focus on humoral and cellular cross-reactivity. Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods A structured literature search was performed using @hit_startMedline@hit_end and @hit_startPubMed@hit_end to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. Results In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral crossreactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed @hit_startvaccines@hit_end which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respi-ratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. Conclusion Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms."

                                "Background: Annually, influenza causes serious illness in 3-5 million people, with upward of 600,000 influenza-associated deaths, globally. People with diabetes are at increased risk of complications from influenza that lead to hospitalizations, including lack of glycemic control, pneumonia, hospitalization, and mortality. Influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end can lower risk of complications, and guidelines recommend it annually for patients with diabetes. Nevertheless, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rates in these patients remain below the global target of 75%. Ob jectives: Focused reviews were undertaken to explore the benefits of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the DM population and to determine characteristics of successful programs in DM and other high-risk populations. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end strategies in higher uptake populations, such as healthcare workers (where @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was mandatory) and the elderly were also reviewed. Discussion: @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end showed that in unvaccinated DM patients, the rate of all-cause mortality was approximately 4% and all-cause hospitalization was 6%, with @hit_startvaccination@hit_end reducing the risk by 47% (95% CI, 25 to 62) and 52% (95% CI, 6 to 76), respectively. However, these outcomes do not adequately capture the direct burden of influenza. Noticeably absent from the literature are outcomes measuring direct burden on the patient, such as change in work productivity, diabetes-related complications, and incremental financial burden on the patient. Despite a potential overlap with other chronic conditions, such as cancer and HIV, where influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is also recommended, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rates in DM are equal or slightly higher than these other conditions. Factors leading to success in high uptake populations included good communication with the target population, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end policies and availability/accessibility of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is beneficial in the DM population and should be considered an important tool in diabetes self-management. More research could assess which patient characteristics promote increased flu @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake in DM and which patient intervention outreach programs increase influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end."

                                "Objectives: This study aims to assess the efficacy of Dengue @hit_startVaccine@hit_end. Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end with a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted using randomized controlled clinical trials published between 2000 and 2017 that were identified in the @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end databases via @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, LILACS, @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end. The selection was performed by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. The @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end using the random-effects model was performed. The bias risk assessment was independently performed by two reviewers (L.T.C.S. and B.T.) using the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Collaboration tool to assess the risk of bias from clinical trials [9]. The following criteria were evaluated: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (masking of participants and professionals); detection bias (masking of outcome assessors); friction bias (incomplete outcomes or losses) and reporting bias (reporting of selective outcome). For other biases, we evaluated the conflict of interest. Results: Seven clinical trials were included, with a total of 66,511 participants between the ages of 2 and 45 years. The efficacy of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end as estimated at 44%, with a range from 25% to 59% and high heterogeneity (I2= 80.1%). The serotype-stratified @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was homogeneous, except for serotype 2, with a heterogeneity of 65%. Regarding the immunogenicity, most of the @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end individuals were previously immune to at least one serotype, with seropositivity varying in the studies from 37% to 81%.], All studies presented a high bias risk for conflict of interest. Two papers presented a high risk of bias for the masking of participants and professionals. Conclusions: Compared with other commercially available @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, the dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end showed poor efficacy. Most of the @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end individuals had previous @hit_startimmunity@hit_end for at least one serotype, which generated safety concerns in individuals without previous @hit_startimmunity@hit_end. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end may lead to an unwanted response in the mon-immune @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end subject, questioning the use for disease prevention."

                                "Objectives: To review published data on the global burden of seasonal influenza in terms of epidemiology, economics, and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: The overall incidence of seasonal influenza was estimated from the incidence rates of infected cases in the placebo groups of clinical trials on @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and prophylactic antivirals identified in @hit_startsystematic literature reviews@hit_end. Targeted searches were performed on @hit_startMedline@hit_end to assess: the overall economic burden of influenza from observational studies, HRQoL associated with influenza and excess mortality/hospitalization rates during influenza outbreaks based on statistical regression @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. Geographical scope covered the US, EU5 and Japan. Results: Average incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated between 3.71% in adults and 35.39% in children over 6 and up to 16 years old (yo). Large variability, related to different factors including season, country and target population, was observed between studies. The incidence rate of hospitalization appeared relatively high in < 5 yo children, declined in 5-17 yo children and increased progressively after 18 yo. Patients aged > 65 yo had the highest mortality rates. Type A influenza caused more hospitalizations and deaths than type B. Influenza resulted in a significant economic burden, including office visits, laboratory tests, emergency department visits, hospital stays with possible ICU admission, and medications. Major cost components were the productivity costs (absenteeism of infected adults or parents of infected children), the physician visit costs and the hospitalization costs related to influenza or its complications. Although the HRQoL impact of influenza on the infected population is often highlighted in evaluations of influenza @hit_startvaccines@hit_end and treatments, data on the HRQoL impact of influenza are scarce. Conclusions: Despite efforts to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end high-risk individuals, influenza remains associated with a substantial public health and economic burden in developed countries, mostly related to complications in high-risk patients, and absenteeism in otherwise healthy patients."
