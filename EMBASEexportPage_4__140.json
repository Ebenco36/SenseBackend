                                "Background: Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are a leading cause of hospitalization in infants. Numerous risk factors have been identified in the aetiology of severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospitalisation, including prematurity and congenital heart disease. Down syndrome (DS), a common genetic disorder associated with congenital and dysmorphic features, has recently been identified as an independent risk factor for RSV-associated ALRI requiring hospitalisation; however, the disease burden of RSV-associated ALRI in this population has not yet been established. Similarly, the impact of DS as an independent risk factor has not yet been quantified. We aimed therefore to estimate the incidence of admissions in children with DS, and by comparing this with unaffected children, to quantify the risk of DS independent of other risk factors.",
                                "Methods: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the existing literature published between 1995 and March 1, 2017 was performed to quantify the incidence of hospitalisation due to RSV-associated ALRI in children with DS. @hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end were performed on extracted data using STATA statistical software, and hospitalisation rates for children with and without DS under the age of 2 were calculated.",
                                "Findings: 5 articles were ultimately deemed eligible for @hit_startanalyses@hit_end. @hit_startAnalyses@hit_end were limited to children under the age of 2 years. We calculated the hospitalisation rate for children with DS in this age group to be 117.6 per 1000 child-years (95% CI 67.4-205.2), vs a rate of 15.2 per 1000 child-years (95% CI 8.3-27.6) in unaffected children. This indicates DS contributes to a 6.8 (95% CI 5.5-8.4) fold increase in the relative risk of hospitalisation for RSV-associated ALRI.",
                                "Interpretation: Though limited by a small number of articles, this review found sufficient evidence to conclude DS was a significant independent risk factor for the development of severe RSV-associated ALRI requiring hospitalisation. Further studies are needed to define the impact of DS in conjunction with other comorbidities on the risk of severe RSV infection. Determining benefits of immunoprophylaxis or future @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against RSV in this at-risk population is warranted."

                                "Background Haemophilus influenzae type b is an important cause of invasive bacterial disease in children worldwide. The establishment of epidemiological estimates is an essential first step towards the introduction of H influenzae type b @hit_startvaccine@hit_end into the Chinese national @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end programme. We therefore undertook a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end to estimate the prevalence of H influenzae type b in Chinese children. Methods We systematically searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and Ovid databases for studies published up to Dec 31, 2016, that reported the prevalence of H influenzae type b among children in mainland China. We used random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end to obtain the pooled prevalence of H influenzae type b in healthy children and in those with acute lower respiratory tract infection or bacterial meningitis. Findings 27 studies met prespecified inclusion criteria, and these included 15 783 children in 14 provinces. The pooled prevalence of H influenzae type b in healthy children, children with acute lower respiratory tract infection, and bacterial meningitis was 5.87% (95% CI 3.42-8.33), 4.06% (3.29-4.83), and 27.32% (0.41-54.24), respectively. Metaregression showed that the prevalence of H influenzae type b in healthy children remained stable after the introduction of H influenzae type b @hit_startvaccine@hit_end in 1997 (p=0.725), whereas the proportion of children with acute lower respiratory tract infection due to H influenzae type b showed a decreasing trend (P<0.0001) and was higher in northern China than in the south (p<0.0001). Significant heterogeneity was noted across and within regions (P<0.0001). Differences in sex, age groups, and study sample size did not explain the heterogeneity. Interpretation H influenzae type b is a common pathogen in healthy children and an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection and bacterial meningitis in China. Introduction of H influenzae type b @hit_startvaccine@hit_end into the Chinese national @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end programme could reduce the burden of H influenzae type b disease in China."

                                "OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) remains as a major cause of death in the world. One strategy to reduce TB prevalences is the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Nevertheless, available currently @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is only BCG @hit_startvaccine@hit_end that is known to have the power of protection not more than 100 % and different for each country. The research of TB @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, especially @hit_startvaccines@hit_end that easily manufactured is a challenge for TB free by 2050. Designing and construction of a new @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against TB is an effective effort to reduce TB cases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains five resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) homologues, RpfA-E. In this review article, several relevant studies have been included. This study corcern at design and construction a DNA @hit_startvaccine@hit_end by cloning the RpfB, RpfD, and RpfE genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in to plasmid pcDNA 3.1+ plasmid with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) then PCR amplification products were purified by several different methods. METHODS: The method used in the writing of this paper is the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Collaboration @hit_startReview@hit_end that includes @hit_startliterature@hit_end studies, testing the quality of the study, the characteristics of the data collection, @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, interpretation of results, and clinical trials as well as recommendations for further research. RESULTS: The several respective results were @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end and interpreted which type of Rpf homologues and its construction design that is the most effective and potential as TB @hit_startvaccine@hit_end candidate. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data seem to point to an in vivo role of rpfB in mycobacterial replication rather than to a direct role in reactivation. In a rabbit model of Mtb infection, RpfB is preferentially expressed in dexamethasone treated rabbits versus latently infected animals."

The @hit_startreview@hit_end methods used were influenced by a narrative synthesis approach. The retrieval of papers adhered to recognised reporting standards.",
                                "RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified, which indicated that infants with the lowest gestational ages and birthweights experience the greatest delays. @hit_startVaccination@hit_end timeliness is influenced by hospitalisation and increased postdischarge follow-up. There was a lack of consensus to indicate that parental socio-economic status and level of education were indicators for a delay. The studies propose that many delays are unjustified and not according to genuine contraindications.",

Regular training should help to negate the occurrence of inappropriate delays, and careful discharge planning is needed to ensure that preterm infants are @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end on time.",

The recent surge in pertussis cases and the increase in @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end administered make this a topic requiring further exploration.",

                                "Little is known about oncology provider recommendations regarding best practices in contraception use during cancer treatment and through survivorship for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients. This @hit_startreview@hit_end examined the @hit_startliterature@hit_end to identify related studies on contraception recommendations, counseling discussions, and methods of contraception in the AYA oncology population. A @hit_startliterature review@hit_end was conducted using @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, including all peer-reviewed journals with no publication date exclusions. A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the @hit_startliterature@hit_end was conducted using combinations of the following phrases or keywords: \"oncology OR cancer\" AND \"contraception, family planning, contraceptive devices, contraceptive agents, intrauterine devices OR IUD, @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, spermatocidal agents, postcoital, immunologic, family planning, vasectomy, tubal ligation, sterilization\" AND \"young adult OR adolescent\" AND \"young adult AND adolescent\". Reviewers assessed articles using the \"Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies\" which considers: (1) selection bias; (2) study design; (3) confounders; (4) blinding; (5) data collection methods; and (6) withdrawals and dropouts. A total of five articles were included and all studies were quantitative. Results showed no consistent recommendations among providers, references to guidelines, or methods of contraceptive types. Provider guidelines for discussions with AYA patients should be expanded to provide comprehensive, consistent, and quality cancer care in the AYA population."

                                "Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) was recommended in 2012 for young children in the Sahel during the peak malaria transmission season. Children are given a single dose of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combined with a 3-day course of amodiaquine, once a month for up to 4 months. Roll-out and scale-up of SMC has been impressive, with 12 million children receiving the intervention in 2016. There is evidence of its overall benefit in routine implementation settings, and a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of clinical trial data showed a 75% decrease in clinical malaria compared to placebo. SMC is not free of shortcomings. Its target zone includes many hard-to-reach areas, both because of poor infrastructure and because of political instability. Treatment adherence to a 3-day course of preventive treatment has not been fully documented, and could prove challenging. As SMC is scaled up, integration into a broader, community-based paradigm which includes other preventive and curative activities may prove beneficial, both for health systems and for recipients."

                                "Background: Worldwide, pertussis remains a major health problem among children. During the recent outbreaks of pertussis, maternal antenatal @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end was introduced in several industrial countries. This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end aimed to synthesize evidence for the efficacy and safety of the pertussis @hit_startvaccination@hit_end that was given to pregnant women to protect infants from pertussis infection. Methods: We searched literature in the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Central Register of Controlled Trials, @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, and OpenGrey between inception of the various databases and 16 May 2016. The search terms included 'pertussis', 'whooping cough', 'pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end,' 'tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis @hit_startvaccines@hit_end@hit_start'@hit_end and 'pregnancy' and 'perinatal'. Results: We included 15 articles in this review, which represented 12 study populations, involving a total of 203,835 mother-infant pairs from the US, the UK, Belgium, Israel, and Vietnam. Of the included studies, there were two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the rest were observational studies. Existing evidence suggests that @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end administered during 19-37 weeks of gestation are associated with significantly increased antibody levels in the blood of both mothers and their newborns at birth compared to placebo or no @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. However, there is a lack of robust evidence to suggest whether these increased antibodies can also reduce the incidence of pertussis (one RCT, n = 48, no incidence in either group) and pertussis-related severe complications (one observational study) or mortality (no study) in infants. Meanwhile, there is no evidence of increased risk of serious complications such as stillbirth (e.g. one RCT, n = 103, RR = 0, meaning no case in the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end group), or preterm birth (two RCTs, n = 151, RR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.14-5.21) related to administration of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end during pregnancy. Conclusion: Given that pertussis infection is increasing in many countries and that newborn babies are at greatest risk of developing severe complications from pertussis, maternal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the later stages of pregnancy should continue to be supported while further research should fill knowledge gaps and strengthen evidence of its efficacy and safety."

                                "Background: Despite the introduction of HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, the incidence of HPV-related cancers (cervical, penile, @hit_startanal@hit_end, vulvar, vagina, head, and neck) in sub-Saharan Africa has been rising. The increasing incidence of these HPV-related cancers has been attributed to changes in lifestyle-related risk factors, most notably sexual behavior. The main objective of this study is to map evidence on the distribution of HIV-related cancers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We will conduct a scoping review to explore, describe, and map literature on the distribution of HPV-related cancers in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary search will include peer-reviewed and review articles. The list of references from included studies will also be searched. The search will be performed using EBSCOhost platform by searching the following databases within the platform: Academic search complete, health source: nursing/academic edition, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end with full text, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, Science Direct, Google scholar and World Health Organization (WHO) library databases, and gray literature. The researcher will search the articles using keywords, from the included studies; abstract and full articles will be screened by two independent reviewers. The screening will be guided by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thematic content @hit_startanalysis@hit_end will be used to present the narrative account of the reviews, using NVivo version 10. Discussion: We anticipate finding relevant literature on the distribution of HPV-related cancers in sub-Saharan Africa. The study findings will help reveal research gaps to guide future research. @hit_startSystematic review@hit_end registration: PROSPERO CRD42017062403."

                                "BACKGROUND: Most countries recommend that healthcare workers (HCWs) are @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end seasonally against influenza in order to protect themselves and patients. However, in many cases coverage remains low. A range of strategies have been implemented to increase uptake. Qualitative evidence can help in understanding the context of interventions, including why interventions may fail to achieve the desired effect. This study aimed to synthesise evidence on HCWs' perceptions and experiences of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end for seasonal influenza.",
                                "METHODS: @hit_startSystematic review@hit_end of qualitative evidence. We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end and included English-language studies which reported substantive qualitative data on the @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of HCWs for seasonal influenza. Findings were synthesised thematically.",
                                "RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in the review. HCWs may be motivated to accept @hit_startvaccination@hit_end to protect themselves and their patients against infection. However, a range of beliefs may act as barriers to @hit_startvaccine@hit_end uptake, including concerns about side-effects, scepticism about @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness, and the belief that influenza is not a serious illness. HCWs value their autonomy and professional responsibility in making decisions about @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. The implementation of interventions to promote @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake may face barriers both from HCWs' personal beliefs and from the relationships between management and employees within the targeted organisations.",
                                "CONCLUSIONS: HCWs' @hit_startvaccination@hit_end behaviour needs to be understood in the context of HCWs' relationships with each other, with management and with patients. Interventions to promote @hit_startvaccination@hit_end should take into account both the individual beliefs of targeted HCWs and the organisational context within which they are implemented."

                                "METHODS: A search of Ovid @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startPsychINFO@hit_end, Scopus, Gender Studies Database, and SocINDEX from July 1999 through July 2016 was performed. We included studies that reported original data, used an interventional study design, included reproductive-aged women or men, were written in English, and were published in peer-reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently used standardized instruments for data extraction and quality assessment. A narrative synthesis was performed.",
                                "SYNTHESIS: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental, pre-post, and time-series designs. Most studies were conducted in the United States; all but one study included only women. Interventions were mainly educational initiatives focused on nutrition, @hit_startimmunization@hit_end, and lifestyle behaviours and were delivered in a single contact. The studies reported positive effects on health knowledge (n = 9), behaviour change (n = 4), and health outcomes (n = 1). Study quality was weak (n = 11) or moderate (n = 1), with limitations related to selection bias, blinding, data collection methods, and participant attrition.",
                                "CONCLUSION: To develop a comprehensive, standardized approach to preconception health promotion and care in Canada, there is a clear need for high-quality research evaluating the effectiveness of preconception health interventions. Studies should use a health equity lens that includes all individuals of reproductive age and addresses the broad determinants of preconception health."
