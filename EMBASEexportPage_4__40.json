                                "One important assumption in case-control studies is that control selection should be independent of exposure. Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that virus interference might lead to a correlation between receipt of influenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and increased risk of infection with other respiratory viruses. We investigated whether such a phenomenon might affect a study design commonly used to estimate influenza @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness (VE). We searched publications in @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, and Web of Science. We identified 12 studies using the test-negative design (2011-2017) that reported VE estimates separately derived by 3 alternative control groups: 1) all patients testing negative for influenza (FLU), VE FLU-; 2) patients who tested positive for other/another respiratory virus (ORV), VE ORV+; and 3) patients who tested negative for all viruses in the panel (PAN), VE PAN-. These included VE estimates from 7 countries for all age groups from 2003/2004 to 2013/2014. We observed no difference in @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage between the ORV-positive and PAN-negative control groups. A total of 63 VE FLU- estimates, 62 VE ORV+ estimates, and 33 VE PAN- estimates were extracted. Pooled estimates of the difference in VE (\"VE) were very similar between groups. In @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression, no association was found between the selection of control group and VE estimates. In conclusion, we did not find any differences in VE estimates based on the choice of control group."

                                "OBJECTIVE A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of quasi-experimental studies in the field of infectious diseases was published in 2005. The aim of this study was to assess improvements in the design and reporting of quasi-experiments 10 years after the initial review. We also aimed to report the statistical methods used to @hit_startanalyze@hit_end quasi-experimental data. DESIGN @hit_startSystematic review@hit_end of articles published from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, in 4 major infectious disease journals. METHODS Quasi-experimental studies focused on infection control and antibiotic resistance were identified and classified based on 4 criteria: (1) type of quasi-experimental design used, (2) justification of the use of the design, (3) use of correct nomenclature to describe the design, and (4) statistical methods used. RESULTS Of 2,600 articles, 173 (7%) featured a quasi-experimental design, compared to 73 of 2,320 articles (3%) in the previous review (P<.01). Moreover, 21 articles (12%) utilized a study design with a control group; 6 (3.5%) justified the use of a quasi-experimental design; and 68 (39%) identified their design using the correct nomenclature. In addition, 2-group statistical tests were used in 75 studies (43%); 58 studies (34%) used standard regression @hit_startanalysis@hit_end; 18 (10%) used segmented regression @hit_startanalysis@hit_end; 7 (4%) used standard time-series @hit_startanalysis@hit_end; 5 (3%) used segmented time-series @hit_startanalysis@hit_end; and 10 (6%) did not utilize statistical methods for comparisons. CONCLUSIONS While some progress occurred over the decade, it is crucial to continue improving the design and reporting of quasi-experimental studies in the fields of infection control and antibiotic resistance to better evaluate the effectiveness of important interventions."

                                "Background: multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease with a progressive course. Disease modifying therapy has accomplished a reduction in the traffic of pro-inflammatory cells through the blood brain barrier and modulation within the central nervous system but has not prevented disease progression. Objectives: intrathecal activity of the immune system in MS seems to be dependent on the meningeal tertiary lymphoid organs (mTLO). We hypothesize a possible therapeutic route that could prevent disease progression based on the role of homeostatic B-cell attracting chemokine CXCL13. Methods: @hit_startPubMed@hit_end review (2001-2017) entering keywords meaning TLO, lymphogenesis, CXCL13, MS. Results: 1) the TLO originates de novo in non-lymphoid tissue by lymphoid neogenesis becoming the determinant key in the patho-genesis of autoimmune diseases; 2) infection and/or @hit_startimmunization@hit_end trigger the formation of transient germinal centers (GC) which resolve after antigen clearance; 3) the GC are localized within the follicles of the lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid organs (SLO) and do have prominent lymphocytic mitosis; 4) the secondary GC are critical in the development of B-cell immune response providing necessary infrastructure for the capture and storage of antigens which drive-in cell division and maturation, B-cell selection with high affinity for immunoglobulin receptors and differentiation of B-cells and plasma cells; 5) ectopic GC perpetuate autoimmune disease by maintaining antibody diversity, isotype switching, B-cell differentiation, oligoclonal expansion and pro-duction of auto-reactive plasma cells at the local site of inflammation; 6) the chemokines CXCL13 and CXCL12 play a key role in the process of lymphoid organogenesis which is shared by SLO and TLO; 7) CXCL13 is produced within the SLO in dendritic follicular cells and macrophages; 8) when the mTLO are established in the time span of MS is still unknown; 9) high levels of CXCL13 are present in the CSF of patients with the clinically isolated syndrome who convert to clinically definitive MS within two years; 10) complementary intrathecal therapy could be necessary for the deactiva-tion of the mTLO to arrest disease progression; 11) a novel therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting CXCL13 has shown therapeutic effect in the Th17-mediated murine model of MS. Conclusion: complementary early treatment of MS, using CXCL13 blockage, could neutralize the formation of the mTLO reducing risk of disease progression."

                                "Introduction The efficacy of oral cholera @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (OCVs) in laboratory conditions has been established, and the World Health Organization (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) has recommended their preventative use in high-risk settings. The WHO recommendation has not been fully operationalized, nor has it been extended to apply to the reactive use of OCVs in real field epidemic conditions due to concerns about potential resource diversion, feasibility, cost, and acceptability. The purpose of this study is to assess and synthesize existing evidence of OCV effectiveness when used reactively in real field conditions.",
                                "METHODS: A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was conducted involving studies that investigated @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness when used as a reactive measure; that is, cases had reached epidemic threshold and a cholera epidemic was declared in real field epidemic conditions. OVID @hit_startMedline@hit_end (US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (EBSCO Information Services; Ipswich, Massachusetts USA), and @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end (Elsevier; Amsterdam, Netherlands), along with grey literature, were systematically searched using pre-determined criteria. Two independent reviewers identified studies that met the selection criteria and data were extracted using validated tools. Pooled estimates were obtained using fixed effect models.",
                                "RESULTS: Of the 347 articles that met the inclusion criteria, four studies were retrieved for @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end (three were case-control studies and one was a case-cohort study) involving a total of 1,509 participants and comprising 175 cases and 1,334 case controls. The effectiveness of one or two doses of either Shanchol (Shantha Biotechnics; India) or ORC-Vax (Vabiotech; Vietnam) OCVs showed a combined @hit_startvaccine@hit_end effectiveness of 75% (95% CI, 61-84).",

                                "Objectives: Examine long-term incidence trends of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancer in Norway, and estimate the number of cancer cases preventable by @hit_startvaccines@hit_end against HPV 16/18 or HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58. Design: Observational registry-based study. We extracted incident cases of HPV-related cancer during 1953-2015 from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Tumour HPV prevalence estimates from large international @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end or from Norway were used to estimate the protective potential of HPV @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Participants and setting: The Norwegian population. Primary outcome measures: Incidence trend @hit_startanalyses@hit_end during 1953-2015 for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, vulva, vagina, oropharynx, anus and penis, and adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Additionally, the number of cancer cases preventable by HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Results: Among women, incidences of SCC of the anus, oropharynx, vulva and cervical adenocarcinoma increased, while vaginal SCC showed no trend. For these cancers combined, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) during 1953-2015 was 1.2 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.6). The incidence of cervical SCC generally decreased during 1976-2004 and remained stable thereafter. Among men, incidences of SCC of the anus, oropharynx and penis increased. The AAPC during 1953-2015 combined for all male HPV-related cancer was 1.9 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.5). A @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against HPV 16/18 might yearly prevent 402 (95% CI 382 to 420) cancers. A @hit_startvaccine@hit_end against HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58 might yearly prevent 478 (95% CI 464 to 490) cancers, of which 206 (95% CI 202 to 209) occur in non-cervical organs, and 113 (95% CI 110 to 115) occur among men. Conclusions: The incidences of HPV-related cancers that are not effectively prevented by screening have generally increased during 1953-2015. HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end can prevent a substantial number of cancers in Norway, in cervical and non-cervical organs, among women and men."

                                "Background: Checkpoint inhibitors, tumor @hit_startvaccines@hit_end or cellular immunotherapies demonstrated prolonged survival versus placebo or observation in several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to clarify the benefits of imunotherapy by a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of RCTs data. Methods: We searched for RCTs investigating immunotherapy versus placebo or observation in patients with advanced NSCLC. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated as combined hazard ratios (HRs). The quality of the evidence was evaluated with the GRADE framework. Results: Overall, 23 RCTs including a total of 8,956 patients were identified (5,142 patients in the immunotherapy group and 3,814 in the placebo or observation group). High-to moderate-quality evidence indicated that immunotherapy prolonged OS (HR = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.84, P < 0.0001) and PFS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88, P < 0.0001). In subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, high-to moderate-quality evidence revealed immunotherapy extended NSCLC survival and PFS in tumor @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (HR, 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92 and 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94 for OS and PFS, respectively), checkpoint inhibitors (0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.83 and 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.90, respectively), maintenance therapy (0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.83 and 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91, respectively), first-line therapy (0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98 and 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91, respectively), previous definitive chemotherapy (0.72, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.78 and 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95, respectively), and concurrent chemotherapy (0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95 and 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.91, respectively). There was a benefit of immunotherapy in previous definitive chemotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy and with concurrent administration of chemotherapy (OS as HR: P = 0.002 and P = 0.006, respectively). Conclusions: This @hit_startanalysis@hit_end provides strong evidence for OS and PFS benefit of immunotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, particularly in those receiving tumor @hit_startvaccines@hit_end, checkpoint inhibitors, maintenance and first-line therapy, previous definitive chemotherapy, and with concurrent chemotherapy."

                                "Background: The tumor microenvironment in PDA is heterogeneous and immunosuppressive given the presence of regulatory T cells and exhausted effector T cells. Despite the upsurge of effective immunotherapeutic agents (IA) in other tumor types, the role in PDA remains unknown. We conducted a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of IA in PDA. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end/@hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, Elsevier/@hit_startEmbase@hit_end, Wiley/@hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and ClinicalTrials.gov. Articles were selected per the following criteria: (1) Study participants had a diagnosis of PDA; (2) An IA was used in the trial. Titles, abstracts and full text articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers; disagreements were resolved by a third. Data extraction and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end were performed by 3 independent reviewers. Descriptive @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, mean, median, confidence interval and forest plots were used for statistical @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Results: We found 20,792 studies through the database, 16,105 remained after duplicates were removed and 15,889 were excluded due to irrelevance. Strict inclusion criteria were applied to the full text of 216 articles. The most common reason for exclusion were conference abstracts (44%) and ongoing trials (16%). Fiftyfour trials (39 metastatic (met), 12 adjuvant (Ad) and 3 neoadjuvant (nAd) met criteria for further @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Age range was 27-86 (median 61) and 52.3% were males. IA included cytokine therapy (33%), peptide @hit_startvaccines@hit_end (22%), dendritic cell @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (13%), oncolytic viruses (9%), CTLA-4 inhibitors (2%) and others. IA in met- PDA had a median overall survival (mOS) of 8.1 months (ms) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 55.4% (95% CI, 51.85-58.95). There was no statistical difference in DCR among IA subtypes (range 49- 60%) (p = 0.22). The mOS of Ad-PDA trials was 25 ms (historically comparable to gemcitabine, p = 0.75) and 18 ms for nAd-PDA. The most common Gr1/2 toxicities were skin reactions, fever, and chills and Gr3/4 were cytopenias, diarrhea, and mucositis. One death occurred due to neutropenic sepsis. Conclusions: IA demonstrates modest efficacy in the treatment of met-PDA albeit exhibits a favorable toxicity profile. Many trial results are available only in abstract format and some are ongoing."

                                "BACKGROUND: Despite effective national @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end programmes in Europe, some groups remain incompletely or un-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end ('under-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end'), with underserved minorities and certain religious/ideological groups repeatedly being involved in outbreaks of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end preventable diseases (VPD). Gaining insight into factors regarding acceptance of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end of 'under-@hit_startvaccinated@hit_end groups' (UVGs) might give opportunities to communicate with them in a trusty and reliable manner that respects their belief system and that, maybe, increase @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake. We aimed to identify and describe UVGs in Europe and to describe beliefs, attitudes and reasons for non-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end in the identified UVGs.",
                                "METHODS: We defined a UVG as a group of persons who share the same beliefs and/or live in socially close-knit communities in Europe and who have/had historically low @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage and/or experienced outbreaks of VPDs since 1950. We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end and @hit_startPsycINFO@hit_end databases using specific search term combinations. For the first @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, studies that described a group in Europe with an outbreak or low @hit_startvaccination@hit_end coverage for a VPD were selected and for the second @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, studies that described possible factors that are associated with non-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end in these groups were selected.",
                                "RESULTS: We selected 48 articles out of 606 and 13 articles out of 406 from the first and second search, respectively. Five UVGs were identified in the literature: Orthodox Protestant communities, Anthroposophists, Roma, Irish Travellers, and Orthodox Jewish communities. The main reported factors regarding @hit_startvaccination@hit_end were perceived non-severity of traditional \"childhood\" diseases, fear of @hit_startvaccine@hit_end side-effects, and need for more information about for example risk of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end.",
                                "CONCLUSIONS: Within each UVG identified, there are a variety of health beliefs and objections to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. In addition, similar factors are shared by several of these groups. Communication strategies regarding these similar factors such as educating people about the risks associated with being @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end versus not being @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end, addressing their concerns, and countering @hit_startvaccination@hit_end myths present among members of a specific UVG through a trusted source, can establish a reliable relationship with these groups and increase their @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake. Furthermore, other interventions such as improving access to health care could certainly increase @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake in Roma and Irish travellers."

                                "Purpose To provide evidence-based guidance on the use of platelet transfusion in people with cancer. This guideline updates and replaces the previous ASCO platelet transfusion guideline published initially in 2001. Methods ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end of the medical literature published from September 1, 2014, through October 26, 2016. This review builds on two 2015 @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end that were conducted by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines. For clinical questions that were not addressed by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (the use of leukoreduction and platelet transfusion in solid tumors or chronic, stable severe thrombocytopenia) or that were addressed partially (invasive procedures), the ASCO search extended back to January 2000. Results The updated ASCO review included 24 more recent publications: three clinical practice guidelines, eight @hit_startsystematic reviews@hit_end, and 13 observational studies. Recommendations The most substantial change to a previous recommendation involved platelet transfusion in the setting of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Based on data from randomized controlled trials, adult patients who undergo autologous stem-cell transplantation at experienced centers may receive a platelet transfusion at the first sign of bleeding, rather than prophylactically. Prophylactic platelet transfusion at defined platelet count thresholds is still recommended for pediatric patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation and for adult and pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Other recommendations address platelet transfusion in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors or in those who undergo invasive procedures. Guidance is also provided regarding the production of platelet products, prevention of Rh alloimmunization, and management of refractoriness to platelet transfusion (www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki)."

                                "Background: @hit_startImmunization@hit_end rates for children and adults are rising, but coverage levels have not reached optimal goals. As a result, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end diseases still occur. In an era of increasing complexity of @hit_startimmunization@hit_end schedules, rising expectations about the performance of primary care, and large demands on primary care providers, it is important to understand and promote interventions that work in primary care settings to increase @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage. One common theme across @hit_startimmunization@hit_end programs in many nations involves the challenge of implementing a population-based approach and identifying all eligible recipients, for example the children who should receive the measles @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. However, this issue is gradually being addressed through the availability of @hit_startimmunization@hit_end registries and electronic health records. A second common theme is identifying the best strategies to promote high @hit_startvaccination@hit_end rates. Three types of strategies have been studied: (1) patient-oriented interventions, such as patient reminder or recall, (2) provider interventions, and (3) system interventions, such as school laws. One of the most prominent intervention strategies, and perhaps best studied, involves patient reminder or recall systems. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various types of patient reminder and recall interventions to improve receipt of immunizations. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end to January 2017. We also searched grey literature and trial registers to January 2017. Selection criteria: We included randomized trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series evaluating @hit_startimmunization@hit_end-focused patient reminder or recall interventions in children, adolescents, and adults who receive immunizations in any setting. We included no-intervention control groups, standard practice activities that did not include @hit_startimmunization@hit_end patient reminder or recall, media-based activities aimed at promoting immunizations, or simple practice-based awareness campaigns. We included receipt of any immunizations as eligible outcome measures, excluding special travel immunizations. We excluded patients who were hospitalized for the duration of the study period. Data collection and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by @hit_startCochrane@hit_end and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We present results for individual studies as relative rates using risk ratios, and risk differences for randomized trials, and as absolute changes in percentage points for controlled before-after studies. We present pooled results for randomized trials using the random-effects model. Main results: The 75 included studies involved child, adolescent, and adult participants in outpatient, community-based, primary care, and other settings in 10 countries. Patient reminder or recall interventions, including telephone and autodialer calls, letters, postcards, text messages, combination of mail or telephone, or a combination of patient reminder or recall with outreach, probably improve the proportion of participants who receive @hit_startimmunization@hit_end (risk ratio (RR) of 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 1.35; risk difference of 8%) based on moderate certainty evidence from 55 studies with 138,625 participants. Three types of single-method reminders improve receipt of immunizations based on high certainty evidence: the use of postcards (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30; eight studies; 27,734 participants), text messages (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.44; six studies; 7772 participants), and autodialer (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32; five studies; 11,947 participants). Two types of single-method reminders probably improve receipt of immunizations based on moderate certainty evidence: the use of telephone calls (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.54; seven studies; 9120 participants) and letters to patients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.38; 27 studies; 81,100 participants). Based on high certainty evidence, reminders improve receipt of immunizations for childhood (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.29; risk difference of 8%; 23 studies; 31,099 participants) and adolescent @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.42; risk difference of 7%; 10 studies; 30,868 participants). Reminders probably improve receipt of @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end for childhood influenza (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.99; risk difference of 22%; five studies; 9265 participants) and adult influenza (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.43; risk difference of 9%; 15 studies; 59,328 participants) based on moderate certainty evidence. They may improve receipt of @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end for adult pneumococcus, tetanus, hepatitis B, and other non-influenza @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end based on low certainty evidence although the confidence interval includes no effect of these interventions (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.78; four studies; 8065 participants). Authors' conclusions: Patient reminder and recall systems, in primary care settings, are likely to be effective at improving the proportion of the target population who receive immunizations."
