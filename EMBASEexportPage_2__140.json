                                "Guinea-worm disease is a parasitic disease caused by Dracunculus medinensis. It affects people living in rural and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources for drinking water. Although it mortality is low, morbidity is considerably high and may cause huge disabilities which are devastating. Diagnosis is clinically performed, and no specific treatment nor @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are available. The objective of our review was to describe the epidemiology of Guinea-worm disease published cases. A @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was conducted following the \u201cPRISMA\u201d guideline. @hit_startPubMed@hit_end database was searched using the search terms \u201cDracunculiasis\u201d or \u201cGuinea-worm disease\u201d and limited to case reports published in English or Spanish, but without time frame. Full text articles were assessed for relevance and data extraction was performed as an iterative process. During the initial search 26 articles were obtained, from which 19, containing 25 cases were included. Females were more affected than males (13 vs 12) and the medium age of presentation was of 25 years (+/-SD 16.69). The 67% of the patients came from Africa and Nigeria was the country which reported the most (36%). Pain (60%), swelling (36%) and fever (16%) were the most common initial clinical manifestations, and the presence of an ulcer containing the Guinea-worm was found during physical examination in only 40% of the cases. Diagnosis was most commonly done through histopathology (56%). Surgery was performed in 48% of the cases and mechanical extraction in 36%. The decision to do not perform no treatment at all was taken in 16% of the cases. Mortality rate was of 4%. Guinea-worm disease has been set as the first neglected tropical disease to be eradicated, and as it seems to come to an end, there are few case reports published in the literature. We consider that the trends presented in our @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end, rather than being @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end from a historic point of view, should be taken as a lesson by health professionals to enhance the active surveillance of the remaining cases. No patient should be left behind and reemergence must be prevented."

                                "Yellow fever (YF) virus is a flavivirus endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. However, due to a rapid increase in trade and travel volume globally, there is an increased risk of importation of YF to non-endemic areas. We @hit_startsystematically review@hit_end data from travel-associated YF to help estimate the international risk of YF spread into non-endemic areas. @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, ProMed, and online repositories from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organization databases were searched from inception to March 2018. We included all reports describing travel-related YF acquired in endemic countries. Variables of interest were extracted and plotted in Tableau software. We identified 497 unique publications and included 25. Between 1924 and 2018, 38 travel-associated YF cases have been reported. European and non-European-travelers accounted for 16 (42.1%) and 22 (57.9%) of the subjects, respectively. The countries that reported the most cases of imported YF cases were China (28.9%), USA (13.2%) and France (13.2%). Forty-two percent of the importation countries had competent YF vectors, but autochthonous YF transmission in the non-endemic area did not occur. Travelers acquired the disease in South America (56.8%) and Africa (42.2%). Brazil (38.9%), Angola (30.6%), Peru (8.3%), and Senegal (5.6%) were the countries most visited among travelers where YF was acquired. The traveler's mean age was 39.4 \u00b1 12.4 years, and males predominated (76.7%). All except two (5.3%) were unvaccinated. YF was diagnosed with molecular assays (48.1%), a combination of assays (37%), and serology (7.4%). Hospitalization data was available for 32 (84.2%) cases, and of those 31 (96.9%) were admitted and 7 (58.3%) went to ICU care. Fifteen (48.4%) patients died from their illness. In conclusion, nonimmunized travelers are at-risk of YF complications and capable of seeding local transmission in their countries. There is an urgent need to reinforce the implementation of YF @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in travelers visiting high-risk areas."

                                "Understanding how the ABO blood group interacts with Plasmodium falciparum malaria will provide insights on the pathogenesis of falciparum malaria and provide direction for basic research that may help the development of novel antimalarial treatments and @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Specifically, investigating the genetic basis that reduces susceptibility to severe P. falciparum infection may lead the formulation of personalized strategies designed to prevent deaths due to severe P. falciparum infection. We systematically summarized information on the effect of ABO blood group on severe P. falciparum infection, level of parasitemia and hemoglobin. We searched literature published in @hit_startPubmed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end, Web of Science, CNAHL and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library from inception to February 04, 2017 without restriction. We retrieved 1,923 articles were from five databases: @hit_startEmbase@hit_end (n=728), @hit_startPubMed@hit_end (n=620), Web of Science (n=549), @hit_startCINAHL@hit_end (n=14) and @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library (n=12). After removal of duplicates and two levels of screening, we selected 24 articles for inclusion in the @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and 22 for the @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. A @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of 15 studies showed an increased odds of severe P. falciparum infection (vs uncomplicated P. falciparum infection) among individuals with blood group A (summary Odds Ratio [OR] 1.34; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.06, 1.62); B (OR 1.48; 95%CI:1.16, 1.79); AB (OR 1.43; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.87); or non-O (A, B or AB) (OR 1.61; 95%CI: 1.31, 1.91) compared with blood group O. A @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of four studies showed a significantly greater level of P. falciparum parasitemia among individuals with blood group A than those of blood group O (mean difference: 1769.2; 95%CI: 848.9, 2689.4). However, a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of four studies showed lack of significant difference in hemoglobin level among P. falciparum infected individuals of blood group A as compared with those of blood group O. This study suggests that individuals with blood group A, B and AB are more susceptible to severe P. falciparum infection and blood group O has a protective effect. However, the ABO blood group may not affect P. falciparum infection related reduction in hemoglobin level."

                                "Dengue virus is a global health problem. Tetravalent Dengue @hit_startVaccine@hit_end (CYDTDV) was the first @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to gain regulatory approval to try and address this problem. There is an urgent need for an effective and safe dengue @hit_startvaccine@hit_end to reduce morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population given the lack of specific treatment at present. A safe @hit_startvaccine@hit_end that protects against Dengue virus diseases is a global health priority. This review and network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end aimed to summarize all available evidence on the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of four serotypes of all available types of dengue @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. The data is gathered from randomized controlled clinical trial from 13 databases. The Protocol was registered at PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42016052578. Studies that reported the efficacy and immunogenicity of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in the prevention of dengue virus infection and effects on the severity of the disease were included in this review with no restriction to language. Data was extracted by three independent authors. Data were @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end by R software. Out of 518 studies identified by the electronic and manual search, 44 studies were included in our @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. @hit_startVaccines@hit_end used were CYD-TDV, TDV, AvP TDV, TDENV PIV, TDEN F17, TDEN F19, TV003-TV005, WRAIR& GSK @hit_startvaccine@hit_end DEN1, DEN2 and DEN4 versus controls which were placebo or other @hit_startvaccines@hit_end such as meningococcal polysaccharide A+C, typhoid VI polysaccharides, varicella etc. Regarding risk ratio (RR) of injection site swelling, arthralgia, and fatigue in @hit_startvaccine@hit_end groups; results were insignificant in network @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end in contrast to control group. However, in CYD-TDV and AvP TDV groups, the headache was significantly in contrast to controls RR=1.23 95%CI (1.06-1.43) and 18.45 95%CI (1.21-281.98) respectively. Seropositive conversion against serotype 1 was significantly higher in most of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end groups in contrast to control. We expect to find safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end in the prevention of dengue virus infection, and effects on the severity of the disease as we complete the @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of the study. ."

                                "Typhoid is a serious health issue, particularly in South Asia and in some regions of Africa. In addition to the high burden of endemic cases of the disease in these countries, outbreaks of typhoid pose a major challenge for the public health system. The recent outbreak of ceftriaxone resistant Salmonella Typhi in Pakistan led us to @hit_startreview@hit_end the @hit_startliterature@hit_end on typhoid outbreaks in Asia and regions of Africa to identify the case definitions, diagnostic criteria and methods used for outbreak control. We searched @hit_startPubMed@hit_end (1964-2018) for studies describing the outbreaks of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A and B in Asia and Africa. Articles on mathematical modeling, papers describing laboratory methods of the outbreak strain were also excluded. Out of a total 185 relevant articles, only 38 met the eligibility criteria.Of these, 10 outbreaks were reported from Africa and 28 from Asia. Reports from Africa were from 7 countries , 60% (6/10) were from south Africa, Zimbabwe and Uganda. The reports from Asia were from 14 countries of which 28%(8/28) were from India. More than 80% of the outbreaks were reported between 2000-2017. Varying case definitions and lab methods were used for the outbreaks. In Africa 80% of the reports used some form of lab investigation to confirm the cases, 25% used serology, 87% used a combination of blood culture and PCR. In Asia 82% used a lab method for case confirmation. Most (86%) used stool and blood cultures. The source of the outbreak was identified in 50% outbreaks in Africa of which 80% were due to contaminated food. In Asia 14% were due to contaminated food and 44%(12/27) due to contaminated water. In Africa 30% of studies took steps to control the outbreaks. In Asia 35%(11/28) took outbreak response measures, of which 45%(5/11) used WSH methods and 27% (3/11) used health education. Typhoid @hit_startvaccination@hit_end as control measure was used in only one outbreak in Africa and 2 in Asia. This review highlights the importance of developing standardized case definition, laboratory confirmation and guidelines for outbreak response to use in response to typhoid outbreaks as currently there are none provided by the WHO or CDC."

                                "Introduction: Two types of @hit_startvaccines@hit_end are currently licensed for use against pertussis: whole-cell (wP) and acellular pertussis (aP). There is evidence that wP confers more durable @hit_startimmunity@hit_end than aP, however wP has been more frequently associated with adverse events following @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end (AEFI). A comparison of the frequency of AEFI with the first doses of wP and aP has not yet been clearly documented. This must be done in light of recent considerations to move towards a wP prime-aP boost @hit_startvaccination@hit_end strategy in low and middle-income countries. Objectives: To compare the frequency of AEFI associated with the first dose of the wP and aP @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. We also compared the frequency of AEFI associated with subsequent doses of wP. Methods: This @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end was carried out in strict accordance with the published protocol. Results: High heterogeneity amongst included one-armed studies did not allow for pooling of prevalence estimates. The prevalence estimates of AEFI at first @hit_startvaccine@hit_end dose of wP ranged from 0 to 75%, while the prevalence estimates of AEFI at first @hit_startvaccine@hit_end dose of aP ranges from 0 to 39%. The prevalence estimates of adverse events following second and third @hit_startvaccine@hit_end dose of wP ranged from 0 to 71% and 0 to 61%, respectively. Risk ratios among two-armed studies showed an increased risk of adverse events with first dose of wP compared to aP [local reaction RR 2.73 (2.33, 3.21), injection site pain RR 4.15 (3.24, 5.31), injection site swelling RR 4.38 (2.70, 7.12), fever over 38 \u00b0C RR 9.21 (5.39, 15.76), drowsiness RR 1.34 (1.18, 1.52) and vomiting RR 1.28 (0.91, 1.79)]. Conclusion: Our results confirm that, when comparing the first dose, wP is more reacotgenic than aP. The proposed wP prime followed by aP boost pertussis @hit_startvaccine@hit_end strategy should be approached with caution."

                                "Introduction: Patients with a weakened immune system due to immunosuppressive treatment are at increased risk of infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end is highly recommended for those patients, the effectiveness of pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in this population remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this PROSPERO-registered @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end was to evaluate the effect of the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), or rituximab, on the initial serologic response to pneumococcal @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in patients with auto-immune disease. Methods: We included 22 articles comprising 2077 patients, of whom 1623 were treated with immunosuppressive agents, and 454 were controls. Results and discussion: The findings of our @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end indicate that, in patients treated with immunosuppressive medication and compared to controls, the initial serologic response to pneumococcal conjugate @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide @hit_startvaccine@hit_end (PPSV) are impaired. Moreover, this impaired response was more profound after PCV than after PPSV. We hypothesize that the immunosuppressive medication mainly compromises the cellular @hit_startimmunity@hit_end, explaining the more severely reduced response rate to PCV (which induces a T-cell dependent immune response), compared to PPSV. Treatment with TNF\u03b1 blocking agents was associated with a more favorable response, compared to patients treated with other immunosuppressive medication. Targeted research applying uniform correlates of protection is needed to bridge the knowledge gap in @hit_startvaccination@hit_end immunology in this patient group.

                                "Background: Bacterial meningitis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide among children aged 1\u201359 months. We aimed to describe its burden in South Asia, focusing on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end aetiologies. Methods: We searched five databases for studies published from January 1, 1990, to April 25, 2017. We estimated incidence and aetiology-specific proportions using random-effects @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. In secondary @hit_startanalyses@hit_end, we described @hit_startvaccine@hit_end impact and pneumococcal meningitis serotypes. Results: We included 48 articles cumulatively reporting 20,707 cases from 1987 to 2013. Mean annual incidence was 105 (95% confidence interval [CI], 53\u2013173) cases per 100,000 children. On average, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) accounted for 13% (95% CI, 8\u201319%) of cases, pneumococcus for 10% (95% CI, 6\u201315%), and meningococcus for 1% (95% CI, 0\u20132%). These @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end had substantial between-study heterogeneity (I@sup_begin2@sup_end > 78%, P < 0.0001). Among studies reporting only confirmed cases, these three bacteria caused a median of 78% cases (IQR, 50\u201387%). Hib meningitis incidence declined by 72\u201383% at sentinel hospitals in Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively, within two years of implementing nationwide @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. On average, PCV10 covered 49% (95% CI, 39\u201358%), PCV13 covered 51% (95% CI, 40\u201361%), and PPSV23 covered 74% (95% CI, 67\u201380%) of pneumococcal meningitis serotypes. Lower PCV10 and PCV13 serotype coverage in Bangladesh was associated with higher prevalence of serotype 2, compared to India and Pakistan. Conclusions: South Asia has relatively high incidence of bacterial meningitis among children aged 1\u201359 months, with @hit_startvaccine@hit_end@hit_start-preventable@hit_end bacteria causing a substantial proportion. These estimates are likely underestimates due to multiple epidemiological and microbiological factors. Further research on @hit_startvaccine@hit_end impact and distribution of pneumococcal serotypes will inform @hit_startvaccine@hit_end policymaking and implementation."

                                "Background: In Pakistan, @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage has been quite low since the program's inception, and the 2012-2013 population-based survey recorded it at 54%. Much has been written about the issues, challenges, and constraints in the implementation of Pakistan's @hit_startimmunization@hit_end program. However, there is a need to better understand the health system barriers as well as levers that influence progress. This review aims to bridge the information gaps on system-level barriers that currently impede the optimal delivery and uptake of @hit_startimmunization@hit_end services to the children of Pakistan through the Expanded Program on @hit_startImmunization@hit_end (EPI). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive @hit_startliterature review@hit_end, using @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and Google Scholar to find peer-@hit_startreviewed literature@hit_end, and also @hit_startreviewed@hit_end EPI-related international and national reports. Additionally, we consulted government reports, surveys, and publications on the health system. Employing the basic tenets of WHO's health systems framework for health system strengthening, and a socio-ecological model, this study cataloged the service delivery and the demand side perspective on various pillars of Pakistan's @hit_startimmunization@hit_end program. Results: Themes generated from the @hit_startliterature review@hit_end included financing, governance, service delivery, human resources, information systems, and supplies and @hit_startvaccines@hit_end. Findings suggest that certain areas in the larger health system need to be improved for a more coordinated implementation of EPI in Pakistan. Moreover, it is imperative to understand community behaviors and perceptions as well as demand side issues in order to achieve the desired results. Conclusion: For better @hit_startimmunization@hit_end coverage and ultimately a reduction in child mortality due to preventable diseases, EPI operations and performance must be improved. Further systematic implementation research could help to develop an even finer understanding of the system-wide bottlenecks encumbering the coverage and efficiency of the program."

                                "Background: To assess if hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in adults is causally associated with autoimmune diseases. Such causation has been claimed based mainly on case reports and uncontrolled studies, and a syndrome \u2018Autoimmune/autoinflammatory Disorder Induced by Adjuvants\u2019 (ASIA) has been claimed to be linked to @hit_startimmunization@hit_end, particularly hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods: Review of peer-@hit_startreviewed literature@hit_end from January 1990 to March 2017 identifying controlled studies with documented incidence of autoimmune diseases occurring after hepatitis B @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end in adults. From 1297 studies identified, 259 were further assessed and 49 reviewed further; 19 relevant papers reporting 21 results are reviewed here, and 14 results included in a @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end. Results: Overall no association between hepatitis B @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and the onset of autoimmune diseases was seen. The overall odds ratio was 1.06, with 95% confidence limits of 0.93\u20131.21, with non-significant heterogeneity. Only one study showed a significant excess risk between hepatitis B @hit_startimmunisation@hit_end and autoimmune disease. Conclusions: Despite multiple case reports, there is no reliable scientific evidence of autoimmune diseases being caused by hepatitis B @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end."
