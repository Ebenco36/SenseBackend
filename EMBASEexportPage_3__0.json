                                "Background: It has been suggested that @hit_startvaccines@hit_end have NSE on morbidity and mortality due to infections others than those targeted by the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end or for unknown reasons. Some observational studies showed increased relative risks (RR) of all-cause mortality with DTP containing a whole-cell pertussis component. Based on a recent review and @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end of selected studies (Higgins, BMJ 2016), the WHO concluded that the results are inconsistent. However, the WHO @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end and its conclusions were challenged. Objectives: To assess the potential impact of bias and confounding on the estimated RR of all-cause mortality after DTP. Methods: Based on methodological considerations on study design and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end, we systematically assessed all 17 DTP studies from the WHO review for risk of selection bias, exposure and outcome misclassification, confounding, and differential co-interventions with other @hit_startvaccines@hit_end including co-administration. We performed @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end on all studies and complemented with @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression, including the assessed sources of bias and confounding as covariates. Permutation tests were used to control the risk of false positives. Results are expressed as relative risk ratios (RRRs), with RRR >1 indicating that the RR estimate is larger when the covariate is present, compared with absent. Uni- and multi-variable @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regressions were performed. Results: The overall RR of all-cause mortality after DTP @hit_startvaccination@hit_end based on all studies was 1.32 (95% CI: 0.83-2.08). Based on uni-variable @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression, the highest RR estimate was for studies conducted in Africa (RRR = 3.16, p = 0.002), studies using the landmark approach (RRR = 2.97, p = 0.015) and studies at high risk of selection bias (RRR = 2.28, p = 0.039), exposure misclassification (RRR = 2.28, p = 0.05) and confounding (RRR = 2.65, p = 0.052). These covariates cluster in studies from Africa (n = 11) and their individual impact could not be disentangled using multi-variable regression. Conclusions: Our results suggest that several potential sources of bias and confounding are significantly associated with increased RR of allcause mortality after DTP. Bias and confounding can therefore not be ruled out as an explanation of the increased RR. Higher quality data are needed for a robust evaluation of NSE of DTP studies."

                                "Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide and is the primary cause of cervical cancer, as well as several other cancers. An effective @hit_startvaccine@hit_end is available that prevents the majority of HPV strains, and the CDC recommends routine @hit_startvaccination@hit_end beginning at age 11 or 12 years. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to synthesize (and assess heterogeneity within) the existing evidence regarding the reported proportion of physicians who intended to prescribe the HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. Methods: The MOOSE (@hit_startMeta@hit_end@hit_start-analysis@hit_end Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines were used throughout the design, execution and reporting of this study. A systematic search of @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startPsychInfo@hit_end, @hit_startMedline@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, and Google Scholar was performed using relevant medical subject heading (MeSH) terms. Proportions were abstracted and reviewed independently by three reviewers, with disagreements settled by consensus. All @hit_startmeta@hit_end@hit_start-analyses@hit_end used random effects models with restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) to estimate between study variance. Subgroup @hit_startanalysis@hit_end and @hit_startmeta@hit_end-regression @hit_startanalysis@hit_end were performed to investigate and reduce heterogeneity. Results: There were six studies (providing a total of 10 data points) on physician endorsement or recommendation of the HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end. The proportion of physicians who intended to prescribe the HPV @hit_startvaccination@hit_end ranged from 66% to 97%. However, there was a high degree of heterogeneity (overall I2 = 96.4%) between studies. A significant amount of heterogeneity could be attributed to the age of intended recipient, with physicians more likely to recommend @hit_startvaccination@hit_end to older girls: 73% (95% CI: 68%-78%), 89% (95% CI: 76%-95%), and 95% (95% CI: 84%-98%) for recipients aged <14 years, 14-17 years, and greater than 17 years, respectively (p = 0.0014). Still, heterogeneity was high within these age categories and specific estimates of pooled effects should be used with care. Conclusions: Our findings show that physicians are very likely to recommend the HPV @hit_startvaccine@hit_end overall and less likely to recommend the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end for those aged less than 14 years, which is contrary to the CDC recommendations. This could potentially lead to reduced intention to @hit_startvaccinate@hit_end and reduced adherence to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end schedule. Furthermore, studies have shown that catch-up @hit_startvaccinations@hit_end later in life may have a reduced utility."

                                "Purpose: To identify reported practices for cross-infection control in dental laboratories and to quantify the importance of the flaws encountered. Data sources: Systematic search (cross-infection AND dental laboratory) at @hit_startEMBASE@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, SciELO and Scopus databases. Study selection: Papers reporting on cross-sectional studies providing original data about crossinfection knowledge, practices and attitudes of dental technicians. Papers reporting on a single laboratory or institution were excluded. Data extraction: Data extraction was undertaken independently by three reviewers using a purpose made form. The outcome of this study was @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end in five aspects, namely process organization, disinfection, working environment, use of individual protective equipment and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end policy. Results of data synthesis: The systematic search output was 1651 references and 11 papers were finally selected. Flaws were more frequently identified in terms of @hit_startvaccination@hit_end policy, biological safety of the working environment and use of individual protective equipment (100%). Slightly better results were found in terms of organization of the cross-infection control process (89.47%) and disinfection practices (85.71%). The application of the formula for disclosing the relative importance of the flaws identified in the literature prioritizes the need for interventions aimed at improving the organization of the cross-infection control procedures, followed by training in item disinfection. The control of the working environment together with the use of individual protective equipments rank closely in importance, followed by the existence of a @hit_startvaccination@hit_end policy Conclusions: Sub-standard cross-contamination practices seem to be a common finding in dental laboratories, which may well compromise the quality of certain dental treatments."

                                "International sustainable development goals for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health problem by 2030 highlight the pressing need to optimize strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Selected or transmitted resistance associated mutations (RAMs) and @hit_startvaccine@hit_end escape mutations (VEMs) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) may reduce the success of existing treatment and prevention strategies. These issues are particularly pertinent for many settings in Africa where there is high HBV prevalence and co-endemic HIV infection, but lack of robust epidemiological data and limited education, diagnostics and clinical care. The prevalence, distribution and impact of RAMs and VEMs in these populations are neglected in the current literature. We therefore set out to assimilate data for sub-Saharan Africa through a @hit_startsystematic literature review@hit_end and @hit_startanalysis@hit_end of published sequence data, and present these in an on-line database (https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/1510659619-3Xkoe2NKkKJ7Drg/). The majority of the data were from HIV/HBV coinfected cohorts. The commonest RAM was rtM204I/V, either alone or in combination with associated mutations, and identified in both reportedly treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced adults. We also identified the suite of mutations rtM204V/I + rtL180M + rtV173L, that has been associated with @hit_startvaccine@hit_end escape, in over 1/3 of cohorts. Although tenofovir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, it is of concern that emerging data suggest polymorphisms that may be associated with resistance, although the precise clinical impact of these is unknown. Overall, there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic screening, enhanced laboratory assessment of HBV before and during therapy, and sustained roll out of tenofovir in preference to lamivudine alone. Further data are needed in order to inform population and individual approaches to HBV diagnosis, monitoring and therapy in these highly vulnerable settings."

                                "Human papillomavirus (HPV) @hit_startvaccination@hit_end uptake in Singapore is low among young women. Low uptake has been found to be linked to low awareness. Thus, this study aimed to understand active and passive @hit_startvaccine@hit_end information-seeking behavior. Furthermore, guided by the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this study examined young women's (aged 21-26 years) processing of information they acquired in their decision to get @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end. ELM postulates that information processing could be through the central (i.e., logic-based) or peripheral (i.e., heuristic-based) route. Twenty-six in-depth interviews were conducted from January to March 2016. Data were @hit_startanalyzed@hit_end using thematic @hit_startanalysis@hit_end. Two @hit_startmeta@hit_end-themes-information acquisition and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end decision-revealed the heuristic-based information processing was employed. These young women acquired information passively within their social network and actively in healthcare settings. However, they used heuristic cues, such as closeness and trust, to process the information. Similarly, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end decisions revealed that women relied on heuristic cues, such as sense of belonging and validation among peers and source credibility and likability in medical settings, in their decision to get @hit_startvaccinated@hit_end. The findings of this study highlight that intervention efforts should focus on strengthening social support among personal networks to increase the uptake of the @hit_startvaccine@hit_end."

                                "Objective: To detect changes in circulating strains of rotavirus in the Eastern Mediterranean Region post rotavirus @hit_startimmunization@hit_end drive. Methods: We searched @hit_startMEDLINE@hit_end, @hit_startPubMed@hit_end, ScienceDirect, and the @hit_startCochrane@hit_end Library and specific database website (Nutrition and Food Sciences) for relevant articles. Our search included websites of a number of relevant organizations in addition to gray literature search. Of the 2198 articles found, we included only 35 studies after excluding irrelevant, ineligible, duplicated, and very low-quality papers. Results: Thirty pre-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end studies reported frequent rotavirus strains among children below 5 years of age. G1P[8] has been identified as the most dominant type prior to @hit_startvaccination@hit_end in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. Five post-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end studies conducted in 3 countries (Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Yemen) illustrated that G1P[8] is the most prevalent strain in Saudi Arabia, and the incidence of G2P[4] has increased from 21.6% to 33.3%. In Yemen, G1P[4] is the most prevalent strain (87.5%), followed by G9P[8] (57%) and G1P[8] (18.5%). Furthermore, in Yemen, G9P[8] were the most prevalent strains accounting to 57% and 14% in G9P[4], post @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Finally, in Morocco, G1P[8] was not reported 3 years post @hit_startvaccination@hit_end; however, incidence of G9P[8] was reported at 67% and G2P[4] at 33%. Conclusions: Rotavirus circulating strain prevalence in EMR countries has changed post @hit_startvaccination@hit_end, and G9P[8], G2P[4], and G9P[4] have become more dominant. Proportion of rotavirus strains in these countries after @hit_startvaccination@hit_end has significantly reduced. There is an increase in circulating strain G2P[4] in the post-@hit_startvaccination@hit_end period, which needs further monitoring."

                                "Background To develop GRADE-based recommendations forthe diagnosis and monitoring of systemic lupus erythematosuspatients in Canada.Methods Recommendations were developed using the GRADE(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development andEvaluation) approach. The Canadian SLE Working Group(panel of Canadian rheumatologists and patient representative from CAPA (Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance)) was created.A series of questions for recommendation development wereidentified based on the results of a survey of SLE practicepatterns of members of the Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA). @hit_startSystematic literature reviews@hit_end of randomized controlled trials and observational studies were conducted.Evidence to Recommendation Tables were prepared and presented to the panel at two face-to-face meetings for discussionand voting during and post-meeting online.Results There were a total of fourteen recommendations forassessing and monitoring lupus patients (table 1). Three recommendations focused on disease activity and damage assessment suggesting that a validated disease activity score per visitand annual damage score were important in evaluating thepatient. One strong recommendation was made for cardiovascular risk assessment with conditional recommendations forosteoporosis (2) and osteonecrosis (1). Three conditional recommendations were made regarding peripartum assessments,one on cervical cancer screening and two on hepatitis B andC screening. A strong recommendation was made for annualinfluenza @hit_startvaccination@hit_end.Conclusions These are the first GRADE-based recommendations for the diagnosis and monitoring of SLE internationally.Evidence is largely of moderate to low quality resulting inmore conditional versus strong recommendations. Furtherstudies of higher quality and special attention to pediatriclupus populations are needed."

                                "Background: Mass gatherings (MGs) such as the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages are known to amplify the risk of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to enhanced transmission of the organism between attendees. The burden of IMD at MGs other than Hajj and Umrah has not previously been quantified through a @hit_startsystematic review@hit_end. Methods: A systematic search for relevant articles in @hit_startPubMed@hit_end and @hit_startEmbase@hit_end was conducted using MeSH terms; this was buttressed by hand searching. Following data abstraction, a narrative synthesis was conducted to quantify the burden of IMD at MGs and identify potential risk factors and mitigation measures. Results: Thirteen studies reporting occurrence of IMD at MGs or similar crowded settings were identified. Eight studies reported cases or outbreaks in MGs of \u22651000 people; five others reported IMD in other crowded settings; all occurred between 1991 and 2015. All age groups were involved in the identified studies; however the majority of cases (\u223c80%) were young people aged 15\u201324 years. The number of affected people ranged from one to 321 cases and the overall crude estimate of incidence was calculated as 66 per 100,000 individuals. Serogroups A, C, B and W were identified, with serogroups A and C being most common. Of 450 cases of IMD reported in non-Hajj/Umrah MGs, 67 (14.9%) had fatal outcomes. Conclusion: IMD outbreaks at non-Hajj/Umrah MGs are generally much smaller than Hajj-related outbreaks and affect mainly young people. Health education and @hit_startvaccination@hit_end should be considered for attendees of high risk non-Hajj/Umrah MGs, especially those involving adolescents and young adults."

                                "Background: End stage renal disease (ESRD) is on the rise globally. Varicella infection among adult patients with ESRD has been reported to lead to multiple complications and even death. While varicella @hit_startvaccination@hit_end has been recommended in paediatric renal patients; recommendation on varicella @hit_startvaccination@hit_end among adult patients with ESRD remained sparse. This review is aimed at evaluating the impact of varicella infection among adult patients with ESRD and make a recommendation for @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. Methods: Three databases (@hit_startPubMed@hit_end, @hit_startEmbase@hit_end and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (@hit_startCINAHL@hit_end)) were searched in April 2018 with keywords 'varicella, chronic kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, kidney transplantation, end stage renal disease, end stage renal failure, chicken pox, @hit_startvaccine@hit_end, @hit_startvaccination@hit_end and complications'. Results: 29 articles were selected for review. The studies were mainly case reports, and they included measured outcomes: prevalence of seronegativity, impact (morbidity, length of stay, and mortality) of varicella among patients with ESRD, seroconversion rates and safety of varicella @hit_startvaccination@hit_end. The prevalence of seronegativity among varicella-infected ESRD adults was found to be at 42 to 100%. Nineteen deaths were reported. At least 54 patients have had complications from varicella infection. Seroconversion rate post @hit_startvaccination@hit_end was found to be around 64-94%. Conclusion: Varicella is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates in adult patients with ESRD. Varicella @hit_startvaccination@hit_end should be considered for the vulnerable, seronegative patients."
